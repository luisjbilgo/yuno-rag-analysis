It acts as a hardened proxy so AI agents and automation clients can call Yuno APIs over MCP with enterprise‑grade security and session controls.\n\n## Key capabilities\n\n### Security\n\n* API key auth: Requires `YUNO_PUBLIC_API_KEY`, `YUNO_PRIVATE_SECRET_KEY`, and `YUNO_ACCOUNT_CODE`\n* IP validation: Sessions are bound to client IPs\n* Rate limiting: 15 requests per minute per session\n* Session timeouts: 30 minutes idle; 6 hours absolute\n\n### Protocols\n\n* Streamable HTTP transport for bidirectional communication\n* JSON‑RPC 2.0 for standardized request/response\n\n### Session management\n\n* Automatic creation, refresh, and cleanup\n* Scheduled cleanup every 5 minutes\n* Redis backend for persistent session and rate‑limit storage\n\n## When to use the remote server\n\nUse the Remote MCP Server when you want centralized security, observability, and policy enforcement (IP binding, rate limits, TTLs), or when teams and tools should connect without distributing raw API credentials locally. For rapid prototyping on a developer machine, the [local MCP](/docs/building-ai-integrations-with-yunos-llms-and-mcp) (CLI‑launched) may be sufficient.\n\n## Connecting from MCP‑compatible clients\n\nThe Remote MCP Server exposes an HTTP transport endpoint. Configure your MCP client to connect to your provisioned URL and pass the required headers.\n\nSample configuration (HTTP transport):\n\nJSON\n\n```\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"Yuno\": {\n      \"transport\": \"http\",\n      \"url\": \"https://prod.y.uno/yuno-mcp/mcp\",\n      \"headers\": {\n        \"public-api-key\": \"<YOUR_PUBLIC_API_KEY>\",\n        \"private-secret-key\": \"<YOUR_PRIVATE_SECRET_KEY>\",\n        \"account-code\": \"<YOUR_ACCOUNT_CODE>\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> 📘\n>\n> Your `PUBLIC_API_KEY`, `PRIVATE_SECRET_KEY`, and `ACCOUNT_CODE` can all be obtained from the [Yuno dashboard](https://dashboard.y.uno/).\n\n## Related information\n\n* For local development and how MCP maps Yuno API endpoints into tools, see [Building AI Integrations with Yuno's LLMs and MCP](/docs/building-ai-integrations-with-yunos-llms-and-mcp).\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Building AI Integrations with Yuno's LLMs and MCP](/docs/building-ai-integrations-with-yunos-llms-and-mcp)[3D Secure](/docs/3d-secure)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Key capabilities](#key-capabilities)\n  + - [Security](#security)\n    - [Protocols](#protocols)\n    - [Session management](#session-management)\n  + [When to use the remote server](#when-to-use-the-remote-server)\n  + [Connecting from MCP‑compatible clients](#connecting-from-mcpcompatible-clients)\n  + [Related information](#related-information)", "images": [], "source": "Yuno Docs"}
{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/lite-web-sdk-payment", "title": "Lite SDK (Payment Web)", "content_markdown": "# Lite SDK (Payment Web)\n\nFollow this step-by-step guide to implement and enable Yuno's Lite Web SDK functionality in your application.\n\n## Step 1: Include the library in your project\n\nEnsure the Yuno SDK file is included in your webpage before closing the `</body>` tag. Refer to the example below:\n\nHTML\n\n```\n<script src=\"https://sdk-web.y.uno/v1.3/main.js\"></script>\n```\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### TypeScript Support\n>\n> If you are using TypeScript, Yuno provides a [library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yuno-payments/sdk-web-types) that you can use to see all available methods available in the Yuno Web SDK.\n\n## Step 2: Initialize SDK with the public key\n\nIn your JavaScript application, create an instance of the `Yuno` class by providing a valid **PUBLIC\\_API\\_KEY**. Check the [Get your API credentials](/docs/developers-credentials) guide.\n\nLike the example below, use the initialized class that is attributed to the `yuno`constant.\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst yuno = await Yuno.initialize(PUBLIC_API_KEY);\n```\n\n## Step 3: Start the checkout process\n\nYou will start the checkout process. To do it, use the `yuno.startCheckout` function and provide the necessary parameters.\n\nThe following table lists all required parameters and their descriptions. For optional parameters, go to [Complementary Features](/docs/lite-checkout-sdk#complementary-features).\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `checkoutSession` | Refers to the current payment's [checkout session](/reference/create-checkout-session). Example: `438413b7-4921-41e4-b8f3-28a5a0141638` |\n| `elementSelector` | The element where the SDK will be mounted. |\n| `countryCode` | Determines the country for which the payment process is being configured. See [Country coverage](/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk) for supported countries and their codes. |\n| `language` | Defines the language for payment forms. Options:  * es (Spanish) * en (English) * pt (Portuguese) * fil (Filipino) * id (Indonesian) * ms (Malay) * th (Thai)  . |\n| `onLoading` | Callback function to receive notifications about server calls or loading events during the payment process. |\n| `showLoading` | Controls visibility of Yuno loading/spinner page during payment process. Default: `true`. |\n| `issuersFormEnable` | Enables the issuer's form. Default: `true`. |\n| `showPaymentStatus` | Shows Yuno Payment Status page. Can be used when continuing a payment. Default: `true`. |\n| `card.isCreditCardProcessingOnly` | Optional. When `true`, ensures all card transactions are processed as credit only. Useful in markets where cards can act as both credit and debit. |\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyuno.startCheckout({\n  checkoutSession: \"438413b7-4921-41e4-b8f3-28a5a0141638\",\n  elementSelector: \"#root\",\n  countryCode: \"FR\",\n  language: \"fr\",\n  showLoading: true,\n  issuersFormEnable: true,\n  showPaymentStatus: true,\n  card: {\n    isCreditCardProcessingOnly: true,\n    onChange: ({ error, data }) => {\n      if (error) {\n        console.log('Card form error:', error);\n      } else {\n        console.log('Card form data:', data);\n      }\n    },\n  },\n  onLoading: (args) => {\n    console.log(args);\n  },\n  async yunoCreatePayment(oneTimeToken) {\n    /**\n     * The createPayment function calls the backend to create a payment in Yuno.\n     * It uses the following endpoint https://docs.y.uno/reference/create-payment\n     */\n    await createPayment({ oneTimeToken, checkoutSession });\n    yuno.continuePayment({ showPaymentStatus: true });\n  },\n});\n```\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Transaction Types\n>\n> Payments can be initiated by the customer (CIT) or by the merchant (MIT). You find more information about their characteristics in [Stored credentials](/docs/stored-credentials).\n>\n> The step-by-step presented on this page refers to a customer-initiated transaction without the recurrence option. Typically, it's used in one-time online purchases, in-store purchases, ATM withdrawals, etc.\n\n## Step 4: Mount the SDK\n\nNext, you have to mount the SDK, presenting the checkout based on the payment method selected by your customer. Remember, when using the Lite SDK, you're responsible for displaying the payment methods and capturing the customer's selection. Access [Lite SDK (Payment)](/docs/the-ultimate-checkout-lite) for additional information.\n\nUse the `yuno.mountCheckoutLite()` function by selecting an HTML element and using a valid CSS selector (`#`, `.`, `[data-*]`) to display the checkout for the selected payment method.\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyuno.mountCheckoutLite({\n  /**\n   * can be one of 'PAYPAL' | 'PIX' | 'APPLE_PAY' | 'GOOGLE_PAY' | CARD\n   */\n  paymentMethodType: PAYMENT_METHOD_TYPE,\n  /**\n   * Vaulted token related to payment method type.\n   * Only if you already have it\n   * @optional\n   */\n  vaultedToken: VAULTED_TOKEN,\n});\n```\n\nAfter mounting the SDK, the selected payment method flow will start automatically.\n\n## Step 5: Initiate the payment process\n\nAfter the user has selected a payment method, remember to call `yuno.startPayment()` to initiate the payment flow. Below, you will find an example where `yuno.startPayment()` is called when the user clicks on `button-pay`:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst PayButton = document.querySelector(\"#button-pay\");\n\nPayButton.addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n  yuno.startPayment();\n});\n```\n\n## Step 6: Get the OTT (one-time token)\n\nOnce the customer fills out the requested data in Yuno's payment forms, the SDK provides the one-time token. The configuration function `yunoCreatePayment(oneTimeToken)` is then triggered with the one-time token.\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyunoCreatePayment(oneTimeToken);\n```\n\nYou can also use `tokenWithInformation` to receive any additional info the customer gives at checkout, such as installments or document type/number.\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyunoCreatePayment(oneTimeToken, tokenWithInformation);\n```\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Loader Management\n>\n> The merchant is responsible for managing the loader. Yuno provides a default loader option, but merchants may implement their own loader if preferred. In that case, they are responsible for making the necessary configurations.\n\n## Step 7: Create the Payment\n\nOnce you have completed the steps described before, you will be able to create a payment. The back-to-back payment creation must be carried out using the [Create Payment endpoint](/reference/create-payment). The merchant should call their backend to create the payment within Yuno, using the one-time token and the checkout session.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Continue Payment Method\n>\n> Yuno recommends integrating the `continuePayment` method of the SDK after the payment is created. This is because certain asynchronous payment methods require additional action from the customer to complete the payment. The API will inform you of this scenario via the `sdk_action_required` field of the response, which will be returned as true. The `yuno.continuePayment()` function will display additional screens to customers, where they can carry out the necessary actions to complete the payment. If `sdk_action_required` is false, this step is not necessary.\n\n## Complementary features\n\nYuno Web SDK provides additional services and configurations you can use to improve customers' experience:\n\n* [Form loader](/docs/lite-checkout-sdk#loader)\n* [Bank Issuer List](/docs/lite-checkout-sdk#form-of-the-issuer)\n* [Render mode](/docs/lite-checkout-sdk#mode-of-form-rendering)\n* [Card form configurations](/docs/lite-checkout-sdk#card-form-configurations) \n  + [Save Card for future payments](/docs/lite-checkout-sdk#save-card-for-future-payments)\n  + [Render mode](/docs/lite-checkout-sdk#rendering-modes)\n  + [Text payment form buttons](/docs/lite-checkout-sdk#text-payment-form-buttons)\n  + [Persist credit card form to retry payments](/docs/lite-checkout-sdk#persist-credit-card-form-to-retry-payments)\n  + [Hide Pay button](/docs/lite-checkout-sdk#hide-pay-button)\n\n### Loader\n\nControl the use of the loader.\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `showLoading` | You can hide or show the Yuno loading/spinner page. Enabling this option ensures that the loading component remains displayed until either the `hideLoader()` or `continuePayment()` function is called. The default value is true. |\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyuno.startCheckout({\n  showLoading: true,\n});\n```\n\n### Form of the issuer\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `issuersFormEnable` | Through this parameter, you can configure the SDK to enable the issuer's form (bank list). |\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyuno.startCheckout({\n  issuersFormEnable: true,\n});\n```\n\n### Mode of form rendering\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Enhanced Render Mode in Lite SDK v2.0\n>\n> The enhanced Lite SDK v2.0 provides advanced render mode capabilities that embed Yuno's checkout forms directly within your interface. This gives you complete control over the checkout journey, including loading, status, and payment input screens, with full visual customization and seamless UX integration.\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `renderMode` | This optional parameter determines how payment forms are displayed. |\n|  | * `type`: Either `'modal'` or `'element'`. |\n|  | * `elementSelector`: Required if `type` is `'element'`. Specifies where to render the form. |\n| `elementSelector` | Required when `type` is `'element'`. Specifies where to mount the Yuno SDK. |\n|  | * **String** (Deprecated): ID or selector for mounting the SDK. |\n|  | * **Object**: Specify elements for APM and action forms: |\n|  | * `apmForm`: Element to display the APM. |\n|  | * `actionForm`: Element for the **Continue Payment** button, which opens a modal for completing provider-specific payment steps. |\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyuno.startCheckout({\n  renderMode:\n```\n\n### Card form configurations\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `card` | Define specific settings for the credit card form: |\n|  | - **`type`**: `step` or `extends` |\n|  | - **`styles`**: You can edit card form styles. Only you should write css, then it will be injected into the iframe. |\n|  | - **`cardSaveEnable`**: Show checkbox for save/enroll card. The default value is false. |\n|  | - **`texts`**: Custom texts in the Card forms buttons. |\n|  | - **`onChange`**: Callback function triggered when card information state changes. This method is called whenever a card-related event occurs, such as during data fetching (loading), after completion, when a network is selected (mastercard-cartes bancaires, visa-cartes bancaires, etc), or when the card form is reset. Receives `{error, data}` where `data` contains card IIN information and installment options. This works the same as secure fields `options.onChange` method. |\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyuno.startCheckout({\n  card: {\n    type: \"extends\",\n    styles: \"\",\n    cardSaveEnable: false,\n    texts: {},\n    isCreditCardProcessingOnly: true,\n    onChange: ({ error, data }) => {\n      if (error) {\n        console.log('Card form error:', error);\n      } else {\n        console.log('Card form data:', data);\n      }\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n#### Save card for future payments\n\nIn addition, you can display a checkbox for saving or enrolling cards using the `cardSaveEnable: true`. Below are examples of the checkbox for both card form renders.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/bd62c09d3eaf421c95d0df7574f346d99b863383f86cdb3d570d344f7ecf2b3b-complementary-features.png)\n\n#### Rendering modes\n\nBelow you find screenshots presenting the difference between the following:\n\n* Render modes `modal` and `elements` for the payment method list\n* Render modes `step` and `extends` for the credit card form\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/6af3c546704cb7a9474fecdf1dc9a139b611ae585ae72074faeb2a6ea3c620b0-caracteristicas_Complemetarias_web_1.png)\n\nYou also can choose one of the render options for the card form, `step` and `extends`:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/c9b56c608ae9542d7f78dd8b9406054eee82169a3b8f3c3b22c8338d9b797939-caracteristicas_Complemetarias_web_2.png)\n\n#### Text payment form buttons\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `texts` | Provide custom text for payment form buttons to match your application's language or branding. |\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyuno.startCheckout({\n  texts: {\n    customerForm?: {\n      submitButton?: string;\n    }\n    paymentOtp?: {\n      sendOtpButton?: string;\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n#### Persist credit card form to retry payments\n\nIf a transaction is rejected, you can use the credit card form to retry a payment after the customer has entered the credit card details. To do that, you will need to:\n\n1. Add the following parameter while initializing the SDK to persist the credit card form after the one-time use token is created:\n\n   JavaScript\n\n   ```\n   yuno.startCheckout({\n     automaticallyUnmount: false,\n   });\n   ```\n2. In case the transaction is rejected, you will need to:\n   1. Execute the method `yuno.notifyError()` to delete the previously entered CVV for the first transaction.\n   2. Create a new checkout session and update the SDK with the new one by executing `yuno.updateCheckoutSession(checkoutsession)`\n3. Continue with the new checkout and one-time use token with the regular payment flow.\n\n#### Hide Pay button\n\nYou can hide the **Pay** button when presenting the Card or Customer Data Forms. To control this feature, you'll set `showPayButton` to `false` when starting the checkout with the `startCheckout` function. The code block below presents an example of how to hide the payment button:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyuno.startCheckout({\n  /**\n   * Hide (false) or show (true) the customer or card form pay button\n   * @default true\n   * @optional\n   */\n  showPayButton: false,\n});\n```\n\nThe following images present examples of the Customer Data Form with and without the Pay button:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/f2fd10924004e11c3776699fe301afd21259eba255f9329f83e3276c19010b64-Card_boton.png)\n\nThe following images present examples of the Card Form with and without the **Pay** button:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/87bfe55c56266fb1d8ffc7cd1f8648840b06353a960b7d2bb7d27cb174eaae53-Card_boton_1.png)\n\nIf you hide the **Pay** button, you will need to start the one-time token creation through your code. To create the one-time token and continue the payment in your backend, call the `submitOneTimeTokenForm` function. The code block below presents how to use the `submitOneTimeTokenForm` function.\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\n/**\n * This function triggers the same functionality that is called when the customer clicks on the pay form button. This approach does not work if you choosed step for rendering mode.\n */\nyuno.submitOneTimeTokenForm();\n```\n\n## Stay Updated\n\nVisit the [changelog](/changelog) for the latest SDK updates and version history.\n\nUpdated 24 days ago\n\n---\n\n[Lite SDK (Enrollment Web)](/docs/enrollment-lite-sdk)[Headless SDK](/docs/headless-sdk-web)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Step 1: Include the library in your project](#step-1-include-the-library-in-your-project)\n  + [Step 2: Initialize SDK with the public key](#step-2-initialize-sdk-with-the-public-key)\n  + [Step 3: Start the checkout process](#step-3-start-the-checkout-process)\n  + [Step 4: Mount the SDK](#step-4-mount-the-sdk)\n  + [Step 5: Initiate the payment process](#step-5-initiate-the-payment-process)\n  + [Step 6: Get the OTT (one-time token)](#step-6-get-the-ott-one-time-token)\n  + [Step 7: Create the Payment](#step-7-create-the-payment)\n  + [Complementary features](#complementary-features)\n  + - [Loader](#loader)\n    - [Form of the issuer](#form-of-the-issuer)\n    - [Mode of form rendering](#mode-of-form-rendering)\n    - [Card form configurations](#card-form-configurations)\n  + [Stay Updated](#stay-updated)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/bd62c09d3eaf421c95d0df7574f346d99b863383f86cdb3d570d344f7ecf2b3b-complementary-features.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/bd62c09d3eaf421c95d0df7574f346d99b863383f86cdb3d570d344f7ecf2b3b-complementary-features.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the payment screen with the payment button highlighted"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/6af3c546704cb7a9474fecdf1dc9a139b611ae585ae72074faeb2a6ea3c620b0-caracteristicas_Complemetarias_web_1.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/6af3c546704cb7a9474fecdf1dc9a139b611ae585ae72074faeb2a6ea3c620b0-caracteristicas_Complemetarias_web_1.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the payment screen on the app"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/c9b56c608ae9542d7f78dd8b9406054eee82169a3b8f3c3b22c8338d9b797939-caracteristicas_Complemetarias_web_2.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/c9b56c608ae9542d7f78dd8b9406054eee82169a3b8f3c3b22c8338d9b797939-caracteristicas_Complemetarias_web_2.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a credit card and a credit card on a white background"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/f2fd10924004e11c3776699fe301afd21259eba255f9329f83e3276c19010b64-Card_boton.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/f2fd10924004e11c3776699fe301afd21259eba255f9329f83e3276c19010b64-Card_boton.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the app interface for the app, showing the user ' s settings"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/87bfe55c56266fb1d8ffc7cd1f8648840b06353a960b7d2bb7d27cb174eaae53-Card_boton_1.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/87bfe55c56266fb1d8ffc7cd1f8648840b06353a960b7d2bb7d27cb174eaae53-Card_boton_1.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the user page of the app, showing the user ' s name and the user name"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

In this guide, you will find instructions on refunding a previously created payment on Yuno.\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo refund a payment, you need to:\n\n* Access your [API credentials](/docs/developers-credentials) on the Yuno Dashboard, which consist of:\n  + `public-api-key`\n  + `private-secrete-key`\n* Have the payment identification data received after creating the payment using the [Create Payment](/reference/create-payment) endpoint and the capture data the capture operation was executed using the [Capture Payment](/reference/capture-authorization):\n  + `id`: The unique identifier of the payment, obtained from the parameter `id` after creating the payment.\n  + `transaction_id`: The unique identifier of the transaction. You will use a different source for this information, depending on how you captured the payment.\n    - If you created and captured the payment using only one operation, you obtain the `transaction_id` from the parameter `transaction.id` after creating the payment with the [Create Payment](/reference/create-payment) endpoint.\n    - If you performed the authorization and then the payment capture, you will use the `transaction_id` from the parameter `id` received after capturing the payment using the [Capture Payment](/reference/capture-authorization) endpoint.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Explore Yuno Postman Collections\n>\n> Yuno provides [Postman Collections](/reference/postman-collections) that you can use to replicate the use cases locally.\n\n## Refund a Payment\n\nIf you initiate a refund, it will reimburse a charge created earlier but not yet refunded. The amount will be credited back to the original payment method that was charged.\n\nUse the [Refund Payment endpoint with transaction](/reference/refund-payment) to perform the refund. To identify the payment to be refunded, you need to provide its `id` and the `transaction_id`. In case you don't need to return a specific transaction use the [Refund Payment endpoint](/reference/cancel-or-refund-a-payment) to perform the refund based on payment. In addition, you need to inform the amount to be refunded using the object `amount` on the body request:\n\n* Complete refund: Leave the `amount` empty.\n* Partial refund: Provide the refund value using the parameter `amount`.\n\nTo confirm you have successfully refunded the payment, check if the parameters from the [Refund Payment endpoint](/reference/refund-payment) response contain the following values:\n\n* `status = REFUNDED`\n* `sub_status = REFUNDED`\n* `transaction.type = REFUND`\n* `transaction.status = SUCCEEDED`\n\nIf the response contains the above values, the refund was successful.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Refund Processing Time\n>\n> Refunds processing time varies depending on the payment type.

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/token-migration-process", "title": "Token Migration Process", "content_markdown": "# Token Migration Process\n\nToken migration is the process of transferring card numbers from an existing provider to Yuno's secure vault. During this process, a new token is generated for each card, ensuring seamless continuity and security for payment processing. The token migration process consists of three main steps:\n\n1. The merchant requests the token migration process from their current payment processor.\n2. Yuno and the payment provider collaborate to securely import all card data into the Yuno token vault.\n3. The merchant uses Yuno's token migration API to map the tokens from the payment provider to the `vaulted_tokens` of Yuno.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### First step\n>\n> To initiate the token migration process, contact your business advisor at Yuno to assess the viability and schedule of the procedure.\n\n## Importing cards from a gateway account (steps 1 and 2)\n\nImporting card data from a gateway account involves handling sensitive information, so strict security protocols must be followed. To import card data into Yuno from an existing gateway, complete the following steps:\n\n1. **Coordinate with the current gateway**: Contact your current third-party vault or gateway and request an export of the payment method data. Ensure you follow their specified protocols.\n2. **Complete the formal request**: Submit a formal request to Yuno, ensuring all required details and processes are documented. The gateway's response time and procedures will determine the data transfer process.\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Your responsibilities when migrating tokens\n>\n> You are responsible for managing communication with your gateway provider throughout the migration process. The Yuno team will support and collaborate directly with the third-party vault/gateway to facilitate the importing process. Additionally, the customer subscription information, including amounts, dates, etc., must be obtained directly from the exporting entity, as Yuno will not extract this data from encrypted files.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Data transfer security\n>\n> All data throughout the migration process is encrypted using PGP keys and transferred using SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol).\n\n## Client-side requirements (step 3)\n\nTo successfully complete the token migration process, it is essential to fulfill the client-side requirements outlined in step 3. This involves providing the necessary user data, including the buyers and their existing payment methods.\n\nYou can execute the token migration process using the Yuno API, which is specifically designed for merchants. As a merchant, you will use this API to:\n\n1. **Add customers**: Register customers in the Yuno system.\n2. **Enroll payment methods**: Register payment methods obtained from payment processors for each customer in the Yuno system.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### API migration option\n>\n> The API migration option allows merchants to manage their customers and their respective payment data. [Learn more](#api-migration)\n\nFor a detailed guide on performing token migration using the API, click the button below:\n\n[#### Token migration via API](via-api)\n\n### Data format\n\nYuno specifies the required parameters for each customer and credit card to proceed with the migration process. The required parameters are listed below:\n\n* Account ID\n* Merchant customer ID\n* First name\n* Last name\n* Email\n* Country\n* Document number\n* Document type\n* Payment method type\n* Payment method ID\n* Payment method token\n\nRefer to the [Customer Object](/reference/the-customer-object) and [Payment Method Object](/reference/the-payment-method-object-api) to explore all possible parameters for importing/creating customers or enrolling payment objects.\n\nTechnical limitations associated with alternative payment methods may make them ineligible for migration between service providers. If you are considering migrating alternative payment method tokens, such as Mercado Pago Wallet Connect or Bancolombia Tokenbox, to the Yuno vault, please contact the Yuno support team.\n\n## Data validation\n\nTo ensure efficient processing and prevent delays during the token migration process, please provide the following information when communicating with Yuno Support:\n\n* The external identifier name that will be used for the import.\n* An approximate count of the expected number of payment methods to be included (a rough estimate is acceptable).\n* Any known data gaps, such as missing names or expiration dates.\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Important notice\n>\n> Yuno does not validate expiration dates during credit card import.\n\n## Data protection\n\nWhen processing payments through Yuno, the platform connects to payment processors. Yuno tokenizes and encrypts the data to ensure security, simplifying the PCI compliance process. However, you are responsible for managing and protecting your customer's data. Additionally, you must communicate any additional fees or issues to your customer.\n\n## Gateway and payment provider requirements\n\nTo proceed with the migration process, you will need to provide the following:\n\n* A public SSH key (you can provide one for production and another for testing). Use the following command to generate it: `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C [email protected]`\n* The outbound IPs that will be used during the migration.\n* A template file of the data to be migrated to understand its structure. It must include the following mandatory data:\n  + **Cardholder name**: The full name of the cardholder as stored by the current provider.\n  + **Expiration date**: The expiry date of the card.\n  + **Card number**: The complete card number (PAN) that will be tokenized by Yuno.\n  + **Card ID**: A unique identifier assigned to each card by the current provider, used by the client for referencing that card during transactions.\n\n### PGP public key\n\nUse our public key to encrypt the PCI-sensitive files you send to Yuno.\n\n**Email**: [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5625333523243f222f7b3b3f312437223f393825162f78233839)\n\n**Comment**: For encrypting sensitive data.

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/enroll-cards-with-payment-link", "title": "Enroll Cards with Payment Links", "content_markdown": "# Enroll Cards with Payment Links\n\nYuno provides merchants with the ability to manage overdue or declined payments using secure payment links. When a credit card expires or is reported as stolen or lost, you can generate a payment link to share with customers via email or text message, allowing them to easily update their payment information.\n\nThis feature is tailored for merchants who operate their own subscription engine and need to update credit card details to continue processing payments with a new `vaulted_token` for their customers.\n\n## Benefits\n\n* **Speed and ease**: Users can resolve payment issues instantly without logging into their account or re-entering all their details\n* **Seamless update**: The new card used in the payment link is automatically saved when the previous card expires or is blocked, preventing future payment issues\n* **Enhanced security**: All payments made through the link are protected with advanced encryption technology\n\nThis feature ensures a smoother payment experience, reducing friction and improving service continuity for users of your subscription product.\n\n## How it works\n\n### 1. Receiving the payment link\n\nWhen users need to update their payment information, they receive a secure payment link. This link allows them to complete any pending payments using a credit or debit card. To create the payment link for enrollment, make sure to include the following fields:\n\n* `customer_payer.id`: The ID of the previously [generated customer](/reference/create-customer)\n* `one_time_use`: Set this to `true` to ensure the payment link can only be used once\n* `vault_on_success`: Set this to `true` to enroll the credit card after a successful payment\n\n### 2. Automatic enrollment\n\nOnce the payment is successfully completed through the link, Yuno automatically generates a new `vaulted_token` for the customer.\n\n### 3. Continue charging\n\nAfter obtaining the `vaulted_token`, you can proceed with your subscription schedule. Use the [Get payment methods](/reference/retrieve-enrolled-payment-methods-api) endpoint to access the customer's payment methods.\n\nFor more information about creating and managing payment links, refer to the [payment link API reference](/reference/create-payment-link).\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Enroll Payment Methods](/docs/enroll-payment-methods)[Installments](/docs/installments)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Benefits](#benefits)\n  + [How it works](#how-it-works)\n  + - [1.

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/seamless-sdk-payment-ios", "title": "Seamless SDK (Payment iOS)", "content_markdown": "# Seamless SDK (Payment iOS)\n\nOn this page, you will find all the steps to add, configure, and use the Seamless iOS SDK to make payments in your iOS project.\n\n> 👍\n>\n> ### Recommended SDK\n>\n> We recommend using the **iOS Seamless SDK** for a smooth integration experience. This option provides a flexible payment solution with pre-built UI components and customization options.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/bb2c987a467228d113d98035f453a459aedfb41554aad3eb49fc50fed8dbf0a0-Screenshot_2025-06-04_at_10.45.05_AM.png)\n\n## Step 1: Include the library in your project\n\nYou can add the library using CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager.\n\n### CocoaPods\n\nTo add the Yuno SDK to your iOS project, you need to install the Yuno SDK. If you do not have a Podfile, follow the [CocoaPods guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html) to create one. After creating the Podfile, you will integrate the Yuno SDK with Cocoapods by adding the line below to your Podfile.\n\nRuby\n\n```\npod 'YunoSDK', '~> 1.19.0'\n```\n\nAfter, you need to run the installation:\n\nRuby\n\n```\npod install\n```\n\n### Swift Package Manager\n\nIf you are using the [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/), add Yuno SDK as a dependency, as presented in the following code block:\n\nSwift\n\n```\ndependencies: [\n    .package(url: \"https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-ios.git\", .upToNextMajor(from: \"1.1.17\"))\n]\n```\n\n## Step 2: Initialize SDK with the public key\n\nTo start running the Yuno iOS Seamless checkout, you first need to get your Yuno app ID and Public API key. Then, import and initialize Yuno as presented in the following code snippet:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nimport YunoSDK\n\nYuno.initialize(\n    apiKey: \"PUBLIC_API_KEY\",\n    config: YunoConfig(),\n    callback: { (value: Bool) in }\n)\n```\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### UISceneDelegate\n>\n> Ensure that if your app uses a `UISceneDelegate`, the Yuno initialization code is placed within your `SceneDelegate`.\n\nThe Seamless checkout enables you to configure the appearance of the SDK. It is an optional step that you configure through the class `YunoConfig`. To set up configurations, use the following code block to configure the available elements:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nfinal class YunoConfig {\n    let cardFormType: CardFormType,\n    let appearance: Yuno.Appearance,\n    let saveCardEnabled: Bool,\n    let keepLoader: Bool\n}\n```\n\nConfigure the SDK with the following options:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `cardFormType` | This field can be used to choose `Payment` and `Enrollment Card` flow. It's an optional property. It uses the `.oneStep` option by default. |\n| `appearance` | This optional field defines the appearance of the checkout. By default, it uses Yuno styles. |\n| `saveCardEnabled` | This optional field lets you choose whether the **Save Card** checkbox is shown on card flows. It is false by default. |\n| `keepLoader` | This optional field provides control over when to hide the loader. If set to `true`, the `hideLoader()` function must be called to hide the loader. By default, it is set to false. |\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Accessing Your API Key\n>\n> You can retrieve your API Key from the [Developers section](../docs/developers-credentials) in the Yuno Dashboard.\n\n### Create a checkout session\n\nBefore starting the payment process, you need to create a `checkout_session` using the [Create checkout session](/reference/create-checkout-session) endpoint. This session initializes the payment flow and will be used in the next step.\n\n#### Key Parameters\n\n| Parameter | Required | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `amount` | Yes | The primary transaction amount object containing `currency` (ISO 4217 code) and `value` (numeric amount in that currency). |\n| `workflow` | Yes | Set the value to `SDK_SEAMLESS` so the SDK can complete the payment flow correctly. |\n| `alternative_amount` | No | An alternative currency representation of the transaction amount with the same structure as `amount` (`currency` and `value`). Useful for multi-currency scenarios, such as displaying prices to customers in their preferred currency (e.g., USD) while processing the payment in the local currency (e.g., COP). |\n\n## Step 3: Start the checkout and Payment process\n\nThe seamless checkout and payment process is initiated with a single method `startPaymentSeamlessLite`. In the `ViewController`, where Yuno will be displayed, call the `Yuno.startPaymentSeamlessLite()` method. You can use the method with async/await or using callbacks:\n\nSwift (async/await)Swift (with callbacks)\n\n```\nfunc startPaymentSeamlessLite(\n    with params: SeamlessParams,\n    paymentSelected: PaymentMethodSelected,\n    showPaymentStatus: Bool = true\n) async -> Result\n```\n\n```\nfunc startPaymentSeamlessLite(\n    with params: SeamlessParams,\n    paymentSelected: PaymentMethodSelected,\n    showPaymentStatus: Bool = true,\n    callback: @escaping ((Result) -> Void)\n)\n```\n\nAdditional parameters are required for the seamless version. These include:\n\n* `PaymentMethodSelected`: The vaulted token and/or the payment method the customer will use to make the payment.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nprotocol PaymentMethodSelected {\n    var vaultedToken: String? { get }\n    var paymentMethodType: String { get }\n}\n```\n\n* `SeamlessParams`\n\nSwift\n\n```\nclass SeamlessParams {\n    var checkoutSession: String\n    var country_code: String\n    var language: String?\n    var viewController: UIViewController?\n}\n```\n\nParameters\n\nThe following table describes each parameter from `SeamlessParams`:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `checkoutSession` | Refers to the current payment's checkout session. |\n| `country_code` | This parameter determines the country for which the payment process is being configured. The complete list of supported countries and their country code is available on the [Country coverage](../docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk) page. |\n| `language` | Defines the language to be used in the payment forms. You can set it to one of the available language options:  * es (Spanish) * en (English) * pt (Portuguese) * fil (Filipino) * id (Indonesian) * ms (Malay) * th (Thai) * zh-TW (Chinese (Traditional, Taiwan)) * zh-CN (Chinese (Simplified, China)) * vi (Vietnamese) * fr (French) * pl (Polish) * it (Italian) * de (German) * ru (Russian) * tr (Turkish) * nl (Dutch) * sv (Swedish) * ko (Korean) * ja (Japanese) |\n| `viewController` | This property represents the `UIViewController` used to present the payment flow. Even though the property remains optional for backward compatibility, you must supply a visible controller so the SDK can present its UI correctly. |\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Swift 6 Concurrency Requirements\n>\n> If you're using Swift 6, you'll need to implement the `YunoPaymentDelegate` protocol with specific concurrency considerations. Swift 6 introduces stricter thread safety requirements that affect how you implement delegates. See the [Implementing `YunoPaymentDelegate` with Swift 6 Concurrency](#implementing-yunopaymentdelegate-with-swift-6-concurrency) section for detailed implementation options and best practices.\n\n## Step 4: Handle Payment Status (Optional)\n\n> ❗️\n>\n> ### Deep Links and Mercado Pago Checkout Pro\n>\n> This step is only required if you're using a payment method that relies on deep links or Mercado Pago Checkout Pro. If your payment methods don't use deep links, you can skip this step.\n\nSome payment methods take users out of your app to complete the transaction. Once the payment is finished, the user is redirected back to your app using a deep link. The SDK uses this deep link to check what happened, checking if the payment was successful, failed, or canceled, and can show a status screen to the user.\n\nTo handle this, you need to update your `AppDelegate` to pass the incoming URL back to the Yuno SDK. This lets the SDK read the result and optionally display the payment status. The following code snippet shows how you can add it to your app:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nfunc application(_ app: UIApplication,\n                 open url: URL,\n                 options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {\n\n  guard url.scheme == \"yunoexample\" else { return false }\n\n  return Yuno.receiveDeeplink(url, showStatusView: true)\n}\n```\n\nThis code listens for deep links that open your app. When a URL is received, it checks if the scheme matches the one you used in the `callback_url` during checkout session setup. If it matches, the URL is passed to the Yuno SDK using `Yuno.receiveDeeplink(...)`. The SDK then reads the payment result and, if `showStatusView` is set to `true`, shows the appropriate status screen to the user.\n\nMake sure the `url.scheme` in this code matches the `callback_url` you provided when creating the `checkout_session`.\n\n## Transaction state\n\nAfter the payment is completed, the SDK can return different transaction states. The list of all possible states and their descriptions are presented in the following table:\n\n| Transaction state | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `success` | Indicates that the transaction or payment process has been completed successfully. |\n| `fail` | This state indicates that the transaction or payment process has failed. It means that there was an error or issue during the payment process that prevented it from being completed successfully. |\n| `processing` | Indicates that the transaction or payment process is currently being processed. It is typically used when there is a delay in payment processing, such as waiting for approval from a third-party service or financial institution. |\n| `reject` | This state indicates that the transaction has been rejected. The rejection can occur for various reasons, such as insufficient funds, fraudulent activity, or requests that violate specific rules or policies. |\n| `internalError` | It means that an unexpected error occurred within the system or infrastructure handling the payment process. This state suggests a problem on the server or backend side rather than an issue with the user's input or request. |\n| `userCancell` | This state indicates that the user has voluntarily canceled or aborted the transaction or payment process. It is typically used when the user has the option to cancel or abandon the payment process. |\n\nThe transaction state can be handled in two ways when using the `startPaymentSeamlessLite` method:\n\n* **Async/Await**: Use the async/await approach for a more streamlined flow. This method returns a Result asynchronously, making the code easier to read and manage.\n* **Callback**: You can handle the transaction state via a callback function, allowing immediate execution once the result is available.\n\nBoth options provide flexibility depending on your preferred approach to asynchronous code.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nenum Result {\n    case reject, success, fail, processing, internalError, userCancell\n}\n```\n\n## Complementary Features\n\nYuno iOS SDK provides additional services and configurations you can use to improve customers' experience. Use the [SDK Customizations](../docs/sdk-customizations-ios) to change the SDK appearance to match your brand or to configure the loader.\n\n* **Loader**: Control the use of the loader through the SDK configuration options.\n* Save card for future payments: In addition, you can display a checkbox for save or enroll cards using `cardSaveEnable: true`. Below, you can find examples of the checkbox for both card form renders.\n\n![Example Checkbox](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe9dPjXE9Y8Uq3EKpmzUrsBpXHCHtspu98NLo41GsszFV1lCCGNsiXvB-9dmQRtPTExcDWQ7S-Qqoq0iFXaeogBZPpONcLy8Ep55cqog0KHHasbstgeCgSTR00BiFmIbcWd4NwHkO7LrLUOsQXnFV1_gT45?key=-31QL7MEbUE8QLWSURQp1jZt)\n\n* You also can choose one of the render options for the card form. Below, you find screenshots presenting the difference between the `cardFormType` `ONE_STEP` and `STEP_BY_STEP`.\n\n![Render Options](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcf2gb-FB3sHbyzXYhwBcio9JJ7i0Vh-WBwHQC1dLul3k5XKGExvmYCApNNdx7DfwZcNgK-ARnQgncc3lE-3ln0chmnKstQL7NBKXXjgM8OHk4JpAeCneddETCFUAIF6xpCGMSDrrsBy7N4lHPcgYncIu7J?key=-31QL7MEbUE8QLWSURQp1jZt)\n\n* [SDK Customizations](../docs/sdk-customizations-ios): Change the SDK appearance to match your brand.\n\n## Implementing `YunoPaymentDelegate` with Swift 6 Concurrency\n\nSwift 6 introduces stricter concurrency requirements that affect how you implement the `YunoPaymentDelegate` protocol. This section explains the challenges and provides solutions for different implementation scenarios.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Understanding Concurrency in Swift 6\n>\n> Concurrency is the ability of your app to manage multiple tasks simultaneously. With Swift 6, concurrency rules have become more stringent to enhance app stability and prevent crashes. This means that your code must be more carefully structured to ensure thread safety and proper task management.\n\n### The problem\n\nWith Swift 6, protocols that inherit from `Sendable` require all their implementations to be thread-safe. This generates warnings when implementing the delegate in classes marked as `@MainActor`.\n\nThread-safe means your code can be safely called from multiple threads without causing crashes or unexpected behavior. `@MainActor` ensures code runs on the main thread (UI thread).\n\n### Our design decision\n\nWe do not mark protocols as `@MainActor` because:\n\n* It would force all implementations to be `MainActor` compatible\n* It would reduce flexibility for merchants who don't use `MainActor`\n* Each implementation has different concurrency needs\n\n### Merchant's responsibility\n\nIt's the merchant's responsibility to handle concurrency according to their implementation. Below are three different approaches you can use depending on your specific needs.\n\n#### Option 1: Immutable properties\n\nThis approach uses immutable properties that are automatically thread-safe, making them ideal for simple configurations. It is best suited for simple apps with fixed configuration values that don't change during runtime.\n\nSwift\n\n```\n@MainActor\nclass MyViewController: UIViewController, YunoPaymentDelegate {\n    \n    private let _countryCode = \"CO\"\n    private let _language = \"EN\"\n    \n    nonisolated var countryCode: String { _countryCode }\n    nonisolated var language: String? { _language }\n    nonisolated var checkoutSession: String { _checkoutSession }\n    \n    nonisolated func yunoPaymentResult(_ result: Yuno.Result) {\n        Task { @MainActor in\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Option 2: Mutable properties with `MainActor.assumeIsolated`\n\nThis approach, best for apps where configuration values might change during runtime (like user preferences), allows for mutable properties while maintaining thread safety by using `MainActor.assumeIsolated`.\n\nSwift\n\n```\n@MainActor\nclass MyViewController: UIViewController, YunoPaymentDelegate {\n    \n    @Published var configLanguage: String = \"EN\"\n    @Published var configCountryCode: String = \"CO\"\n    \n    nonisolated var language: String? {\n        MainActor.assumeIsolated { configLanguage }\n    }\n    \n    nonisolated var countryCode: String {\n        MainActor.assumeIsolated { configCountryCode }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Option 3: For non `MainActor` classes\n\nThis approach is suitable for service classes that don't require `MainActor` isolation, making it best for background services or utility classes that don't interact with the UI.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nclass MyService: YunoPaymentDelegate {\n    \n    let countryCode: String\n    let language: String?\n    let checkoutSession: String\n    let viewController: UIViewController?\n    \n    init(countryCode: String, language: String?, checkoutSession: String, viewController: UIViewController?) {\n        self.countryCode = countryCode\n        self.language = language\n        self.checkoutSession = checkoutSession\n        self.viewController = viewController\n    }\n    \n    func yunoPaymentResult(_ result: Yuno.Result) {\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### ⚠️ Important considerations\n\nWhen implementing concurrency in your delegate, keep these key points in mind:\n\n* `MainActor.assumeIsolated`: Only use when you guarantee it's called from `MainActor`. This is a safety mechanism that tells Swift \"trust me, I know this is running on the main thread.\"\n* `nonisolated`: Means it can be accessed from any thread, so it must be thread-safe. Use this when your properties or methods don't depend on UI state.\n* `viewController`: Remains as `@MainActor` because it should always be accessed from the main thread. UI components must always run on the main thread to prevent crashes.\n\nUpdated 12 days ago\n\n---\n\n[iOS SDK release notes](/docs/ios-release-notes)[Full SDK (iOS)](/docs/full-checkout-ios)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Step 1: Include the library in your project](#step-1-include-the-library-in-your-project)\n  + - [CocoaPods](#cocoapods)\n    - [Swift Package Manager](#swift-package-manager)\n  + [Step 2: Initialize SDK with the public key](#step-2-initialize-sdk-with-the-public-key)\n  + - [Create a checkout session](#create-a-checkout-session)\n  + [Step 3: Start the checkout and Payment process](#step-3-start-the-checkout-and-payment-process)\n  + [Step 4: Handle Payment Status (Optional)](#step-4-handle-payment-status-optional)\n  + [Transaction state](#transaction-state)\n  + [Complementary Features](#complementary-features)\n  + [Implementing YunoPaymentDelegate with Swift 6 Concurrency](#implementing-yunopaymentdelegate-with-swift-6-concurrency)\n  + - [The problem](#the-problem)\n    - [Our design decision](#our-design-decision)\n    - [Merchant's responsibility](#merchants-responsibility)\n    - [⚠️ Important considerations](#%EF%B8%8F-important-considerations)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/bb2c987a467228d113d98035f453a459aedfb41554aad3eb49fc50fed8dbf0a0-Screenshot_2025-06-04_at_10.45.05_AM.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/bb2c987a467228d113d98035f453a459aedfb41554aad3eb49fc50fed8dbf0a0-Screenshot_2025-06-04_at_10.45.05_AM.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "paypal - paypal - paypal - paypal - paypal - paypal - paypal - paypal - paypal - paypal - paypal - paypal - paypal - paypal - paypal - paypal - pay"}, {"original_url": "https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe9dPjXE9Y8Uq3EKpmzUrsBpXHCHtspu98NLo41GsszFV1lCCGNsiXvB-9dmQRtPTExcDWQ7S-Qqoq0iFXaeogBZPpONcLy8Ep55cqog0KHHasbstgeCgSTR00BiFmIbcWd4NwHkO7LrLUOsQXnFV1_gT45?key=-31QL7MEbUE8QLWSURQp1jZt", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/img_1763991365.png", "alt_text": "Example Checkbox", "caption_blip": "the payment screen with the payment button highlighted"}, {"original_url": "https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcf2gb-FB3sHbyzXYhwBcio9JJ7i0Vh-WBwHQC1dLul3k5XKGExvmYCApNNdx7DfwZcNgK-ARnQgncc3lE-3ln0chmnKstQL7NBKXXjgM8OHk4JpAeCneddETCFUAIF6xpCGMSDrrsBy7N4lHPcgYncIu7J?key=-31QL7MEbUE8QLWSURQp1jZt", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/img_1763991366.png", "alt_text": "Render Options", "caption_blip": "a phone with a credit card on the screen"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}
{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/merchant-installments", "title": "Merchant Installments", "content_markdown": "# Merchant Installments\n\nYou can use the Merchant Installments options when you, the merchant, have your own commercial agreements and installment capabilities defined within your payment processors. In this case, you are responsible for handling the logic behind the installment options available for each transaction. When creating the payment, you will inform Yuno of the available number of installments that customers can choose from.\n\n[](https://github.com/writechoiceorg/yuno-images/raw/main/doc/yourPaymentsOperationSystem/installments.mp4)\n\n## How to Use Merchant Installments?\n\nDepending on the way you are connected to Yuno, the process of configuring the installments may vary. Next, we present how you can inform Yuno of the installment option for the Direct workflow and the SDK integration.\n\n### Direct workflow\n\nWhen using a [Direct integration](/docs/direct-flow), you manage the front-end checkout experience. In this case, you will inform Yuno about the number of installments when creating the payment using the [Create Payment](/reference/create-payment) endpoint. The number of installments will be defined through the `payment_method.detail.card.installments` parameter.\n\n### SDK Integration\n\nWhen you use Yuno's SDK, Yuno is responsible for presenting to the customer the installment options available for each payment. As a result, you need to inform Yuno which installments will be available for your account. In this case, the installment configurations are performed through [Yuno's Dashboard](https://auth.y.uno/u/login?). To perform this configuration, execute the two steps described below.\n\n1. First, when configuring your provider [Connection](/docs/connections) in Yuno Dashboard, you need to enable the installments option. Thus, Yuno will show the installment option when the customer chooses the Credit card option form of the SDK checkout.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/3874bb1-installments.png)\n\n2. After enabling the installments, you need to create an installment plan using the [Create Installments Plan](/reference/create-installments-plan) endpoint. When creating a plan, you will specify the accepted currency, amounts, card brands, dates, etc. After that, we will take care of the rest.\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Secure Fields SDK Integration\n>\n> When using Secure Fields SDK integration, you will need to [enable the installments option](secure-fields-payment#step-3-start-the-checkout-process) while starting the checkout process.\n\nFor merchant-created installments, you also have the possibility of specifying the plan for every session by either using:\n\n* the `plan_id` while [creating the session](/reference/create-checkout-session).\n* a `plan structure` while [creating the checkout session](/reference/create-checkout-session).\n\n> ❗️\n>\n> ### Routing with Fallback Providers\n>\n> When setting up your [route](routing) for the Card payment method, it's important to remember that if you have a fallback provider while using installments, we will try to make a fallback payment if the first transaction is rejected. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure that both providers support the amount of installments set for your account. If they do not, you can set up different routes for each scenario to avoid issues.\n\nUpdated 5 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Installments](/docs/installments)[Provider Installments](/docs/provider-installments)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [How to Use Merchant Installments?](#how-to-use-merchant-installments)\n  + - [Direct workflow](#direct-workflow)\n    - [SDK Integration](#sdk-integration)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/3874bb1-installments.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/3874bb1-installments.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the settings menu in the new uip uip"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}
{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/headless-sdk-payment", "title": "Headless SDK (Payment Web)", "content_markdown": "# Headless SDK (Payment Web)\n\n> 👍\n>\n> ### Recommended SDK\n>\n> We recommend using the [Web Seamless SDK](seamless-sdk-payment-web) for a smooth integration experience. This option provides a flexible payment solution with pre-built UI components and customization options.\n\nYuno's Headless SDK lets you create payments. Note that when using the Headless SDK, you will need to request and send via API all the mandatory fields the payment provider requires to generate payment in their API.\n\nYuno's Headless SDK enables you to create payments in two different scenarios:\n\n* Create a [One-Time Use Token](/docs/tokens) using credit card information, then create a payment.\n* Create a [One-Time Use Token](/docs/tokens) using a `vaulted_token` from a previously enrolled credit card, then create a payment.\n\nThe following steps describe creating a payment using Yuno's Headless SDK.\n\n## Step 1: Include the library in your project\n\nBefore proceeding with the Headless SDK implementation, see the [SDK Integration Overview](/docs/build-your-integration) for detailed instructions on how to properly integrate the SDK into your project.\n\nThe integration guide provides three flexible methods:\n\n1. Direct HTML script inclusion\n2. Dynamic JavaScript injection\n3. NPM module installation\n\nChoose the integration method that best suits your development workflow and technical requirements. After completing the SDK integration, you can proceed with the following steps to implement the Headless checkout functionality.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### TypeScript Library\n>\n> If you are using TypeScript, Yuno provides a [library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yuno-payments/sdk-web-types) that you can use to see all available methods in the Yuno Web SDK.\n\n## Step 2: Initialize Headless SDK with the public key\n\nIn your JavaScript application, create an instance of the `Yuno` class by providing a valid `PUBLIC_API_KEY`.\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst yuno = await Yuno.initialize(PUBLIC_API_KEY);\n```\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Credentials\n>\n> See the credentials page for more information: [https://docs.y.uno/reference/authentication](/reference/authentication)\n\n## Step 3: Start the checkout process\n\nNext, you will start the checkout process using the `apiClientPayment` function, providing the necessary configuration parameters.\n\n### Parameters\n\nConfigure the payment with the following options:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `country_code` | This parameter specifies the country for which the payment process is being set up. Use an `ENUM` value representing the desired country code. You can find the full list of supported countries and their corresponding codes on the [Country Coverage](/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk) page. |\n| `checkout_session` | Refers to the current payment's checkout session created using the [Create Checkout Session](/reference/create-checkout-session) endpoint. Example: `'438413b7-4921-41e4-b8f3-28a5a0141638'` |\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst apiClientPayment = yuno.apiClientPayment({\n  country_code: \"US\",\n  checkout_session: \"eec6578e-ac2f-40a0-8065-25b5957f6dd3\"\n});\n```\n\n## Step 4: Generate token\n\nAfter collecting all user information, you can start the payment. First, you need to create a one-time token (OTT) using the function `apiClientpayment.generateToken`. As it is an asynchronous function, you can use `try/catch` to ensure you will correctly handle triggered errors. The following examples show different scenarios to create the one-time token:\n\n1. **Example 1**: Create a one-time token utilizing a card as the payment method and including all requisite card information.\n2. **Example 2**: Create a one-time token using the `vaulted_token` information.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Benefits of Using a Vaulted Token\n>\n> When you use a vaulted token with the SDK, all the fraud information from the providers you configured in your card routing is collected and attached to the one-time token. In addition, you can add installment information and a security code if the provider requires it.\n\nExample 1\n\n```\nconst oneTimeToken = await apiClientPayment.generateToken({\n  checkout_session: \"eec6578e-ac2f-40a0-8065-25b5957f6dd3\",\n  payment_method: {\n    type: \"CARD\",\n    vaulted_token: null,\n    card: {\n      save: false,\n      detail: {\n        expiration_month: 11,\n        expiration_year: 25,\n        number: \"4111111111111111\",\n        security_code: \"123\",\n        holder_name: \"ANDREA B\",\n        type: \"DEBIT\"\n      },\n      installment: {\n        id: \"64ceacef-0886-4c81-9779-b2b3029c4e8b\",\n        value: 1\n      }\n    },\n    customer: {},\n    device_fingerprint: \"0753b47f-bb43-86ab-647b-d735b67baac6\",\n    third_party_session_id: \"QbJU2KolVUm1fhQR0s9qgrS0ArEQmEfE\"\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Parameters for Example 1\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `checkout_session` | The checkout session created using the Create Checkout Session endpoint |\n| `payment_method.type` | Payment method type, set to \"CARD\" |\n| `payment_method.vaulted_token` | Optional: Use if you have a previously enrolled payment method |\n| `card.save` | Optional: Set to \"true\" to generate a vaulted token for the card |\n| `card.detail` | Card information including number, expiration, security code, and holder name |\n| `card.detail.type` | Card type: \"DEBIT\" or \"CREDIT\" |\n| `card.installment` | Optional: Required only if an installment plan is configured |\n| `customer` | Optional: Customer information object |\n| `device_fingerprint` | Optional: Required only if fraud screening is configured |\n| `third_party_session_id` | Optional: Required only if third-party configuration exists |\n\nExample 2\n\n```\nconst oneTimeToken = await apiClientPayment.generateToken({\n  checkout_session: \"eec6578e-ac2f-40a0-8065-25b5957f6dd3\",\n  payment_method: {\n    type: \"CARD\",\n    vaulted_token: \"aad8578e-ac2f-40a0-8065-25b5957f6555\",\n    card: {\n      detail: {\n        security_code: \"123\"\n      },\n      installment: {\n        id: \"64ceacef-0886-4c81-9779-b2b3029c4e8b\",\n        value: 1\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Parameters for Example 2\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `checkout_session` | The checkout session created using the Create Checkout Session endpoint |\n| `payment_method.type` | Payment method type, set to \"CARD\" |\n| `payment_method.vaulted_token` | Use the vaulted token from a previously enrolled payment method |\n| `card.detail.security_code` | Security code for the enrolled card |\n| `card.installment` | Optional: Required only if an installment plan is configured |\n\nThe following code block shows the `apiClientPayment.generateToken` function responses for both examples above:\n\nExample 1\n\n```\n{\n  \"token\": \"ee78bc2a-63b4-45bb-bd28-3e6829ab1c3d\",\n  \"vaulted_token\": null,\n  \"vault_on_success\": false,\n  \"type\": \"CARD\",\n  \"card_data\": {\n    \"holder_name\": \"ANDREA B\",\n    \"iin\": \"41111111\",\n    \"lfd\": \"1111\",\n    \"number_length\": 16,\n    \"security_code_length\": 3,\n    \"brand\": \"VISA\",\n    \"type\": \"CREDIT\",\n    \"category\": \"CREDIT\",\n    \"issuer_name\": \"JPMORGAN CHASE BANK N A\",\n    \"issuer_code\": null\n  },\n  \"customer\": {\n    \"first_name\": \"Cesar\",\n    \"last_name\": \"Sanchez\",\n    \"email\": \"[email protected]\",\n    \"gender\": \"\",\n    \"phone\": null,\n    \"billing_address\": null,\n    \"document\": null,\n    \"browser_info\": {\n      \"user_agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh;

You will inform the one-time token received in [Step 4](/docs/headless-sdk-payment#step-4-generate-an-ott-one-time-token) through the request's `payment_method.token` parameter. The following code block shows a request example for creating a payment:\n\nJSON\n\n```\n{\n  \"merchant_order_id\": \"0000022\",\n  \"country\": \"US\",\n  \"account_id\": \"<Your account_id>\",\n  \"description\": \"Test\",\n  \"amount\": {\n    \"currency\": \"USD\",\n    \"value\": 500\n  },\n  \"customer_payer\": {\n    \"id\": \"cfae0941-7234-427a-a739-ef4fce966c79\"\n  },\n  \"checkout\": {\n    \"session\": \"<checkout session>\"\n  },\n  \"workflow\": \"SDK_CHECKOUT\",\n  \"payment_method\": {\n    \"type\": \"CARD\",\n    \"token\": \"2cd31999-e44e-4de3-bbe4-179981ff4295\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe endpoint response provides the `sdk_action_required` parameter that defines if additional actions are necessary to conclude the payment:\n\n* If your customer selects a synchronous payment method, the payment is completed instantly. In this scenario, the field `sdk_action_required` in the API response will be `false`, and the payment process concludes at this step.\n* When an additional interaction of the SDK is needed to complete the payment flow, `sdk_action_required` will be `true`. If this is the case, you need to follow the instructions from [Step 6](/docs/headless-sdk-payment#step-6-get-the-3ds-challenge-url).\n\n## Step 6: Get the 3DS challenge URL\n\nAs described on the [3DS Card Verification](/docs/3d-secure) page, a payment with 3DS may require an additional challenge to check the customer's identity. If an additional verification step is necessary related to a 3DS verification challenge, the response to the [Create Payment](/reference/create-payment) endpoint will have the following information:\n\n* A `THREE_D_SECURE` transaction type.\n* Status equal to `PENDING` and sub status equal to `WAITING_ADDITIONAL_STEP`.\n* The `sdk_action_required` set as `true`.\n\nTo get the 3DS challenge URL, you should call the `getThreeDSecureChallenge` function, providing the `checkoutSession` used to create the payment.\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst data = await apiClientPayment.getThreeDSecureChallenge(checkoutSession?: string): Promise<{url: string}>\n```\n\nIf the card does not require a challenge to verify the customer's identity, the `url` will return `null`.\n\nIn a web browser, you can open the URL in a new tab or an IFrame. To open the URL in an iframe, you must set the param `embedded = true`. If not, you can omit this parameter, whose default value is `false`. The following code block shows an example of displaying the 3DS challenge content in an IFrame:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\ndocument.querySelector('#element').innerHTML = `\n   <iframe\n     src=\"${data.url}&embedded=true\"\n     height=\"700px\"\n     width=\"100%\"\n     border=\"0\"\n     frameBorder=\"0\">\n   </iframe>\n `;\n\nwindow.addEventListener('message', (event) => {\n   if (\n        !event.origin.toLocaleLowerCase().includes('sdk-3ds') ||\n        event?.data?.origin !== 'CHALLENGE'\n   ) {\n     return\n   }\n   document.querySelector('#element').innerHTML = '';\n   if (event.data.status === 'ERROR') {\n     document.querySelector('#element').innerHTML = 'There was an error';\n   } else {\n     document.querySelector('#element').innerHTML = 'Challenge was finished';\n   }\n});\n```\n\nYou are responsible for redirecting your customers to the URL provided by the `redirect_url` to complete the challenge. Once the customer successfully completes the 3DS challenge, they will be automatically redirected to the `callback_url`, which you provided when creating the `checkout_session` with the [Create Checkout Session](/reference/create-checkout-session) endpoint.\n\nTo complete the Headless SDK payment flow, you need to use [Yuno Webhooks](/docs/configure-webhooks), which will promptly notify you about the outcome of the 3DS challenge and the final payment status. Using webhooks ensures that you receive real-time updates on the progress of the payment transaction. In addition to the webhooks, you can retrieve the payment information using the [Retrieve Payment by ID](/reference/retrieve-payment-by-id) endpoint.\n\n## Step 7: Get payment actions\n\nSometimes the payment may require an extra action to continue the payment flow. To determine what action is needed, you should call the `getContinuePaymentAction` method, providing the `checkoutSession` used to create the payment.\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst data = await apiClientPayment.getContinuePaymentAction({ checkoutSession: string }): Promise<ContinuePaymentAction>\n```\n\nThe `getContinuePaymentAction` method returns a `ContinuePaymentAction` object that describes the specific action required to continue the payment flow, depending on the provider and the specific step required.\n\n### `ContinuePaymentAction` response structure\n\nThe response contains information about the type of action required and the necessary data to perform that action:\n\nTypeScript\n\n```\ntype ContinuePaymentAction = {\n  type: Provider.Type;\n  action: Provider.Action;\n  payment_code?: {\n    code: string;\n    reference: string;\n    expiration_time?: number;\n  };\n  image?: {\n    type: string;\n    value: string;\n    reference: string;\n

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/sdk-customizations-android", "title": "SDK Customizations", "content_markdown": "# SDK Customizations\n\nThe Yuno Android SDK enables you to modify multiple styles, allowing you to align the design of payment forms and the checkout flow with your brand guidelines and UX/UI principles. While the structure of each element remains uniform, you can adjust colors, text, buttons, and much more.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\nYuno Android SDK supports XML themes and styles, which should be defined within your application's styles. Android customizations are a work in progress and are continuously updated.\n\n## Customizable Elements\n\nThe following sections detail the elements that can be modified to achieve a personalized style. Some customizations are unavailable in previous versions, so we recommend using version 1.13.0 or higher.\n\n* [Font styles](#font-styles)\n* [Button styles](#button-styles)\n* [Color styles](#color-styles)\n* [Text styles](#text-styles)\n\n### Font styles\n\nYou can override Yuno Android SDK fonts if you want to use your font family. You can override the following font styles:\n\n* `YunoRegularFont`\n* `YunoMediumFont`\n* `YunoBoldFont`\n\nThe following code block presents an example of how you can configure the font style:\n\nXML\n\n```\n<style name=\"YunoRegularFont\">\n    <item name=\"android:fontFamily\">@font/inter_regular</item>\n</style>\n\n<style name=\"YunoMediumFont\">\n    <item name=\"android:fontFamily\">@font/inter_medium</item>\n</style>\n\n<style name=\"YunoBoldFont\">\n    <item name=\"android:fontFamily\">@font/inter_bold</item>\n</style>\n```\n\n### Button styles\n\nYou can override Yuno Android SDK button styles. The available configurations change depending on your SDK version. The following table lists all available buttons you can customize considering the SDK version.\n\n| Versions before v1.10.0 | Version v1.10.0 and higher | Version v1.13.0 and higher |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `Button.Normal.White` | `Button.Small.NeutralB` | `Button.Normal` |\n| `Button.Normal.Green` | `Button.Normal.NeutralB` | `Button.Small` |\n| `Button.Normal.Purple` | `Button.Normal.Green` | `Button.Normal.NeutralW` |\n| `Button.Normal.Purple.Big` | `Button.Normal.NeutralW.TextGrey4` | `Button.Normal.NeutralW.TextGrey4` |\n|  | `Button.Normal.NeutralW` | `Button.Normal.Green` |\n|  | `Button.Small` | `Button.Normal.NeutralB` |\n|  | `Button.Normal` | `Button.Small.NeutralB` |\n\nFor each style, you can set the following attributes:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\n<style name=\"Button.Normal\" parent=\"Widget.AppCompat.Button.Colored\">\n    <item name=\"android:padding\">YOUR OWN DIMEN</item>\n    <item name=\"android:radius\">YOUR OWN DIMEN</item>\n    <item name=\"android:textAllCaps\">true|false</item>\n    <item name=\"android:textSize\">YOUR OWN DIMEN</item>\n    <item name=\"android:fontFamily\">YOUR OWN FONT</item>\n    <item name=\"android:foreground\">YOUR OWN ATTR</item>\n</style>\n\n<style name=\"Button.Small\" parent=\"Widget.AppCompat.Button.Colored\">\n    <item name=\"android:padding\">YOUR OWN DIMEN</item>\n    <item name=\"android:radius\">YOUR OWN DIMEN</item>\n    <item name=\"android:textAllCaps\">true|false</item>\n    <item name=\"android:textSize\">YOUR OWN DIMEN</item>\n    <item name=\"android:fontFamily\">YOUR OWN FONT</item>\n    <item name=\"android:foreground\">YOUR OWN ATTR</item>\n</style>\n\n<style name=\"Button.Normal.NeutralW\">\n    <item name=\"android:background\">YOUR OWN DRAWABLE</item>\n    <item name=\"android:textColor\">YOUR OWN COLOR</item>\n</style>\n\n<style name=\"Button.Normal.NeutralW.TextGrey4\">\n    <item name=\"android:background\">YOUR OWN DRAWABLE</item>\n    <item name=\"android:textColor\">YOUR OWN COLOR</item>\n</style>\n\n<style name=\"Button.Normal.TextBlack\">\n    <item name=\"android:background\">YOUR OWN DRAWABLE</item>\n    <item name=\"android:textColor\">YOUR OWN COLOR</item>\n</style>\n\n<style name=\"Button.Normal.Green\">\n    <item name=\"android:background\">YOUR OWN DRAWABLE</item>\n    <item name=\"android:textColor\">YOUR OWN COLOR</item>\n</style>\n\n<style name=\"Button.Normal.NeutralB\">\n    <item name=\"android:background\">YOUR OWN DRAWABLE</item>\n    <item name=\"android:textColor\">YOUR OWN COLOR</item>\n</style>\n\n<style name=\"Button.Small.NeutralB\" parent=\"Button.Small\">\n    <item name=\"android:background\">YOUR OWN DRAWABLE</item>\n    <item name=\"android:textColor\">YOUR OWN COLOR</item>\n</style>\n```\n\nThe following code block presents an example of how you can configure a `Button.Normal.NeutralB` button. The example also shows how you can change the button font.\n\nKotlin\n\n```\n<style name=\"Button.Normal.NeutralB\">\n    <item name=\"android:background\">#000000</item>\n    <item name=\"android:textColor\">#FFFFFF</item>\n    <item name=\"android:fontFamily\">@font/inter_regular.ttf</item>\n</style>\n```\n\n### Color styles\n\nYou can override Yuno Android SDK color styles to personalize the SDK's appearance. The available configurations change depending on your SDK version. The following table presents the color styles you can override for each SDK version:\n\n| Versions before v1.10.0 | Version v1.10.0 and higher | Version v1.13.0 and higher |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `yuno_purple_light` | `neutral_b` | `on_focus_outlined_text_view` |\n|  | `neutral_b_60_alpha` | `primary_4` |\n|  | `neutral_w` | `primary_5` |\n|  | `neutral_w_30_alpha` | `secondary_1` |\n|  | `grey_0` | `secondary_2` |\n|  | `grey_1` | `secondary_3` |\n|  | `grey_2` | `secondary_4` |\n|  | `grey_3` | `secondary_5` |\n|  | `grey_4` | `secondary_6` |\n|  | `grey_5` | `tertiary_1` |\n|  | `primary_1` | `tertiary_2` |\n|  | `primary_2` | `tertiary_3` |\n|  | `primary_3` | `tertiary_4` |\n\nThe following code block presents an example of how you can configure the colors when using the SDK with a version equal to or higher than v1.13.0:\n\nXML\n\n```\n<color name=\"neutral_b\">#fff000</color>\n<color name=\"on_focus_outlined_text_view\">#282A30</color>\n```\n\n### Text styles\n\nYou can override Yuno Android SDK text styles to personalize the SDK's appearance.\n\n> This feature is only available for SDK version 1.13.0 or higher.\n\nThe following table lists all customization attributes you can use for each text style:\n\n| Text Style | Parent Style | Customizable Attributes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `YunoRegularFont` |  | `android:fontFamily` |\n| `TextMicro` |

form flow is to create a new layout resource file called `screen_payment_card_form.xml` to override the current XML and implement your design.\n\nAfter creating the `screen_payment_card_form.xml` file, you can define your own design. You need to use the Yuno Secure Fields components, which ensures that the Yuno SDK can retrieve credit card information during the checkout. Below, you will find a list of all the components you can use to change the design:\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Changing Components\n>\n> When changing the Yuno Android SDK components, you must use them with their defined Android `id`.\n\n### v1.10.0 or higher\n\nAdditional components are available for the Yuno SDK version v1.10.0 or higher. These components are listed in the [subsection below](#components-available-for-v1100-and-higher).\n\n* `CloseButton`: Button to close the form.\n\nXML\n\n```\n<ImageView\n        android:id=\"@+id/imageView_close\" />\n```\n\n* `CardNumberEditText`: Field where the user can enter the credit card number.\n\nXML\n\n```\n<com.yuno.payments.features.base.ui.views.CardNumberEditText\n    android:id=\"@+id/textField_number\" />\n```\n\n* `CardDataStackView`: Field where the user can enter the credit card's expiration date and verification code (CVV/CVC).\n\nXML\n\n```\n<com.yuno.payments.features.base.ui.views.CardDataStackView\n    android:id=\"@+id/cardDataStackView\" />\n```\n\n* `TextView` for Voucher card type: This is a copy Yuno SDK shows when the card is `VOUCHER` type, you must set it below the CVV field.\n\nXML\n\n```\n<TextView\n    android:id=\"@+id/textView_voucher_copy\"\n    android:visibility=\"gone\" />\n```\n\n* `TextFieldItemView` for card holder's name: Field where the user can enter the credit card holder's name.\n\nXML\n\n```\n<com.yuno.payments.features.base.ui.views.TextFieldItemView\n    android:id=\"@+id/textField_name\" />\n```\n\n* `SpinnerFieldItemView` for identification document type: A selector where the credit card holder can choose their identification document type.\n\nXML\n\n```\n<com.yuno.payments.features.base.ui.views.SpinnerFieldItemView\n    android:id=\"@+id/spinner_document_type\" />\n```\n\n* `TextFieldItemView` for identification document number: Field where the user can enter the credit card holder's identification document number.\n\nXML\n\n```\n<com.yuno.payments.features.base.ui.views.TextFieldItemView\n    android:id=\"@+id/textField_user_document\" />\n```\n\n* `PhoneInformationView` for customer's phone number: Field where the user can enter his phone number if required. In addition to providing the Android `id`, it's required to have `gone` visibility.\n\nXML\n\n```\n<com.yuno.payments.features.base.ui.views.PhoneInformationView\n    android:id=\"@+id/layout_phone_information\"\n\t\tandroid:visibility=\"gone\" />\n```\n\n* `Installments`: Component that shows the spinner of card installments. In addition to providing the Android `id`, it's required to have `gone` visibility, and you need to add the `ShimmerFrameLayout` dependency: `implementation 'com.facebook.shimmer:shimmer:0.5.0'`.\n\nXML\n\n```\n<LinearLayout\n  android:id=\"@+id/container_installments\"\n  android:orientation=\"vertical\">\n\n  <com.yuno.payments.features.base.ui.views.SpinnerFieldItemView\n  android:id=\"@+id/spinner_installments\"\n  android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n  android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n  android:visibility=\"gone\"\n  app:spinner_title=\"@string/payment.form_installments\" />\n\n  <com.facebook.shimmer.ShimmerFrameLayout\n  android:id=\"@+id/shimmer_installments\"\n  android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n  android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n  android:foregroundGravity=\"center\"\n  android:visibility=\"gone\">\n\n  <include layout=\"@layout/shimmer_component_field\" />\n  </com.facebook.shimmer.ShimmerFrameLayout>\n\n</LinearLayout>\n```\n\n* Yuno's `TextView`: A text to show that Yuno verified the form.\n\nXML\n\n```\n<TextView\n        android:id=\"@+id/textView_secure_payment\" />\n```\n\n* `CustomYunoSwitch`: It's a switch component that lets the user choose if the card will be used as credit or debit.

In addition to providing the Android `id`, it's required to have `gone` visibility. Yuno recommends positioning this component next to the switch.\n\nXML\n\n```\n<ImageView\n                android:id=\"@+id/switch_tooltip\"\n                android:src=\"@drawable/ic_thin_info\"\n                android:visibility=\"gone\"/>\n```\n\n* `AppCompatCheckBox`: A check box users can use to choose whether to save the credit card for future purchases.\n\nXML\n\n```\n<androidx.appcompat.widget.AppCompatCheckBox\nandroid:id=\"@+id/checkBox_save_card\" />\n```\n\n* `Button`: It validates the card form and continues the payment process. When the user clicks this button, the SDK submits the form and sends the credit card information to Yuno.\n\nXML\n\n```\n<Button\n    android:id=\"@+id/button_complete_form\" />\n```\n\n### Components available for v1.10.0 and higher\n\nThe following configurations are only available for SDK v1.10.0 and higher.\n\n* `TextFieldItemView` for customer's address: It is used to input the customer's address when required.

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/retries", "title": "Smart Retries", "content_markdown": "# Smart Retries\n\nEnhance payment success rates using Yuno's Smart Retries. Utilize machine learning to optimize transaction retry attempts.\n\nYuno's Smart Retries use advanced machine learning techniques to determine the best timing for retrying a declined recurring credit card payment. By analyzing a wide range of data points and transaction attributes, it increases the likelihood of payment success, ensuring a consistent revenue stream and reducing involuntary subscriber churn.\n\n### Key advantages\n\nYuno's Smart Retries offer several benefits that enhance payment processes and revenue recovery:\n\n* **Data-driven decision-making**: Leverages machine learning to create the most effective retry schedule.\n* **Enhanced revenue retrieval**: Increases the chances of successfully collecting payments.\n* **Decreased subscriber turnover**: Minimizes disruptions and involuntary subscriber departures.\n* **Flexible logic**: Allows customization of retry schedules to maximize success opportunities.\n* **Comprehensive approach**: Works in conjunction with other revenue recovery strategies.\n\n### Retry schedule\n\nYuno uses a personalized approach for each unsuccessful payment, guided by continuous analysis and machine learning. This method evolves over time to identify the optimal moment for retrying a transaction.\n\n| Event | Deadline after the first attempt |\n| --- | --- |\n| First try | - |\n| Second try | 5 minutes |\n| Third try | 60 minutes |\n| Fourth try | 5 hours |\n| Fifth try | 24 hours |\n| Sixth try | 48 hours |\n| Seventh try | 96 hours |\n\n### Customization\n\nEvery business model is unique, so we allow merchants to define specific rules to enhance the flexibility of our retry schedule. When creating the subscription object, you can use the `retries` structure to make adjustments:\n\n| Parameter | Type | Description | Example |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| retry\\_on\\_decline | bool | Indicates whether to retry a payment after a first decline. Defaults to false. | TRUE |\n| amount | number | Specifies the number of retries the subscription plan will have to completion. If not set, or if higher than 7, the default is 7.

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/full-checkout-android", "title": "Full SDK (Android)", "content_markdown": "# Full SDK (Android)\n\n> 👍\n>\n> ### Recommended SDK\n>\n> We recommend using the [Android Seamless SDK](seamless-sdk-payment-android) for a smooth integration experience. This option provides a flexible payment solution with pre-built UI components and customization options.\n\nThis page provides a guide to the Yuno Full SDK for Android, which offers a complete payment solution with a customizable UI. It provides advanced features like payment method management, fraud prevention, and seamless checkout flows, making it more feature-rich than our Headless SDK, which is specific to core payment processing capabilities.\n\n## Requirements\n\nBefore starting the Yuno Android SDK, ensure your project meets the [technical requirements](/docs/requirements-android). Also, ensure the following prerequisites are in place:\n\n1. You must have an active Yuno account\n2. You need your Yuno API credentials (`account_id`, `public-api-key`, and `private-secret-key`), which you can obtain from the [Developers section of the Yuno dashboard](../docs/developers-credentials). These credentials are required to authenticate requests to the Yuno API. The API is used to:\n\n* Create a `checkout_session`, which initializes the payment flow\n* Create the payment associated with the session\n\n3. Before creating a payment, you must first create a customer using the [Create customer endpoint](/reference/create-customer)\n\n## Step 1: Include the library in your project\n\nInclude the Yuno SDK file in your project through Gradle. Then, add the repository source:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nmaven { url \"https://yunopayments.jfrog.io/artifactory/snapshots-libs-release\" }\n```\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### SDK Version\n>\n> Access the [Release notes](#docs/release-notes-android-sdk) or the [Yuno Android SDK repository](#https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-android) to verify the latest SDK version available.\n\nThen, include the following code in the `build.gradle` file to add the Yuno SDK dependency to the application:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'com.yuno.payments:android-sdk:{last_version}'\n}\n```\n\n### Permissions\n\nYuno SDK includes, by default, the `INTERNET` permission, which is required to make network requests.\n\nXML\n\n```\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" />\n```\n\n## Step 2: Initialize SDK with the public key\n\nRetrieve your public API keys from the [Yuno dashboard](https://dashboard.y.uno/).\n\nIf you haven't implemented a custom application, create one. In the `onCreate()` method of your application class, call the initialize function (`Yuno.initialize`):\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nclass CustomApplication : Application() {\n  override fun onCreate() {\n    super.onCreate()\n    Yuno.initialize(\n      this,\n      \"<your-public-api-key>\",\n      config: YunoConfig,\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Credentials\n>\n> See the credentials page for more information: [https://docs.y.uno/reference/authentication](/reference/authentication)\n\nUse the data class `YunoConfig` to customize the SDK's behavior. Include this configuration when calling `Yuno.initialize()`. The available options are:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\ndata class YunoConfig(\n    val cardFlow: CardFormType = CardFormType.ONE_STEP,\n    val saveCardEnabled: Boolean = false,\n    val cardFormDeployed: Boolean = false,\n    val language: YunoLanguage? = null,\n    val styles: YunoStyles? = null\n)\n```\n\nParameters\n\nThe following table describes each customization available:\n\n| Customization option | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `cardFlow` | It is an optional configuration that defines Payment and Enrollment Card flow. By default, the `CardFormType.ONE_STEP` option is used. Check the [Render options](../docs/full-checkout-android#render-options) section for more information. |\n| `saveCardEnabled` | Enables the Save card checkbox on card flows. Check the [Save card](../docs/full-checkout-android#save-card-for-future-payments) section for more information. |\n| `cardFormDeployed` | This option is only available for Full SDK. If `TRUE`, the system presents the card form deployed on the payment methods list. If `FALSE`, presents the normal card form on another screen. |\n| `language` | Defines the language to be used in the payment forms. You can set it to one of the available language options:  * es (Spanish) * en (English) * pt (Portuguese) * fil (Filipino) * id (Indonesian) * ms (Malay) * th (Thai) * zh-TW (Chinese (Traditional, Taiwan)) * zh-CN (Chinese (Simplified, China)) * vi (Vietnamese) * fr (French) * pl (Polish) * it (Italian) * de (German) * ru (Russian) * tr (Turkish) * nl (Dutch) * sv (Swedish) * ko (Korean) * ja (Japanese) |\n| `styles` | Enables SDK-wide UI customization. Use it to define global visual styles like font family and button appearance (color, padding, radius, typography) through a `YunoStyles` object. For more information, check the [`styles`](../docs/full-checkout-android#styles) section. |\n\nUpdate your manifest to use your application:\n\nXML\n\n```\n<application android:name=\".CustomApplication\"></application>\n```\n\n## Step 3: Create the checkout session\n\nEach payment requires a new `checkout_session`, which provides access to all available payment methods for a specific customer. Use the [Create checkout session](/reference/create-checkout-session) endpoint to obtain a new `checkout_session`. This session is then used to initiate the payment.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### External Browser Return Handling\n>\n> If your payment flow sends users to an external browser (for example, for 3DS authentication or bank redirects), make sure to set the `callback_url` when creating your checkout session. For a step-by-step guide on handling the return to your app, see [Handle external browser return (callback\\_url)](../docs/external-browser-callback-android).\n\n## Step 4: Start the checkout process\n\nCall the `startCheckout` method inside the `onCreate()` function of the activity that initializes the SDK to start a new payment process with the Full SDK:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nstartCheckout(\n  checkoutSession: \"checkout_session\",\n  countryCode: \"country_code_iso\",\n  callbackPaymentState: ((String?) -> Unit)?,\n  merchantSessionId: String? = null\n)\n```\n\n### Parameters\n\nConfigure the checkout with the following options:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `checkoutSession` | A unique identifier for the checkout session associated with the payment. It is required to initialize the payment process and grants access to the customer's available payment methods. |\n| `countryCode` | Country code where the payment is performed. See [Country coverage](/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk) for a complete list of supported countries and their codes. |\n| `callbackPaymentState` | It's a function that returns the current payment process. You don't need to send this function if you don't need the result. |\n| `merchantSessionId` | An identifier used by the merchant to track the payment. |\n\nThe following are the possible states returned by the `callbackPaymentState`:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nconst val PAYMENT_STATE_SUCCEEDED = \"SUCCEEDED\"\nconst val PAYMENT_STATE_FAIL = \"FAIL\"\nconst val PAYMENT_STATE_PROCESSING = \"PROCESSING\"\nconst val PAYMENT_STATE_REJECT = \"REJECT\"\nconst val PAYMENT_STATE_INTERNAL_ERROR = \"INTERNAL_ERROR\"\nconst val PAYMENT_STATE_STATE_CANCELED_BY_USER = \"CANCELED\"\n```\n\nThe following table provides additional information about the possible states:\n\n| **State** | **Description** | **Additional action required** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `SUCCEEDED` | The transaction or payment process was successfully completed without any errors. | No. |\n| `FAIL` | The transaction failed due to errors such as data validation issues, server connection failures, or technical/network problems. | Yes. Investigate the cause of failure (validation, network, server) and take corrective measures. |\n| `PROCESSING` | The transaction is currently in progress, awaiting approval or verification. | No. |\n| `REJECT` | The transaction was rejected due to reasons like insufficient funds or suspected fraudulent activity. | Yes. Inform the user of the rejection, provide the reason if possible, and suggest actions. |\n| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | An unexpected internal error occurred within the system handling the payment process. | Yes. Requires technical intervention to review the system, fix internal issues, and retry or inform the user. |\n| `CANCELED` | The user voluntarily canceled the transaction or abandoned the payment process. | No. |\n\n## Step 5: Add the SDK view to the checkout\n\nUse the `PaymentMethodListViewComponent` to display the available payment methods when implementing the Full SDK with Jetpack Compose. This component provides callbacks to notify your app when to enable or disable the pay button, and when an enrolled payment method is successfully removed.\n\n### Component signature\n\nKotlin\n\n```\n@Composable\nfun PaymentMethodListViewComponent(\n    activity: Activity,\n    modifier: Modifier? = null,\n    onPaymentSelected: (Boolean) -> Unit,\n    onUnEnrollSuccess: (Boolean) -> Unit = {}\n)\n```\n\n### Parameters\n\n* `activity: Activity`\n  + The current `Activity` where the component is hosted. Required to handle payment flows correctly.\n* `modifier: Modifier?` (optional)\n  + Allows you to customise the layout and appearance (for example, padding, spacing). Defaults to `null`.\n* `onPaymentSelected: (Boolean) -> Unit`\n  + Callback invoked whenever a payment method is selected or deselected.\n    - `true` → A method is selected (enable the pay button).\n    - `false` → No method is selected (disable the pay button).\n* `onUnEnrollSuccess: (Boolean) -> Unit` (optional)\n  + Callback invoked when a stored payment method is successfully removed (unenrolled).\n    - `true` → Indicates the removal succeeded.\n    - Can be used to show a snackbar, refresh the list, or update UI state.\n\n### Example\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nval coroutineScope = rememberCoroutineScope()\nval snackbarHostState = remember { SnackbarHostState() }\nvar paymentMethodIsSelected by remember { mutableStateOf(false) }\n\nColumn(\n    modifier = Modifier\n        .weight(1f)\n        .verticalScroll(rememberScrollState())\n) {\n    PaymentMethodListViewComponent(\n        activity = activity,\n        onPaymentSelected = { isSelected ->\n            paymentMethodIsSelected = isSelected\n        },\n        onUnEnrollSuccess = { success ->\n            if (success) {\n                coroutineScope.launch {\n                    snackbarHostState.showSnackbar(\n                        message = \"Your payment method has been removed\",\n                    )\n                }\n            }\n        },\n    )\n}\n```\n\n> ❗\n>\n> ### Important\n>\n> Always wrap the component in a `Column` with `.verticalScroll(rememberScrollState())`. Without this, the list of payment methods may not render or scroll properly when there are multiple methods available.\n\n## Step 6: Initiate the payment process\n\nCall the `startPayment()` method to start a payment process:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nstartPayment(\n    showStatusYuno: Boolean,\n    callbackOTT: (String?) -> Unit = this::onTokenUpdated,\n    callBackTokenWithInformation: (OneTimeTokenModel?) -> Unit = this::onTokenComplete\n)\n```\n\n### Parameters\n\nConfigure the payment with the following options:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `showStatusYuno` | A boolean that specifies whether the payment status should be displayed within the Yuno interface. |\n| `callbackOTT` | A required function that returns the updated one-time token (OTT) needed to complete the payment process. This token is required to complete the payment. |\n| `callBackTokenWithInformation` | A function that supplies detailed information about the one-time token, wrapped in a `OneTimeTokenModel` object, allowing for comprehensive handling of token details. |\n\n## Step 7: Get the one-time token (OTT)\n\nAfter the customer fills out the requested data in Yuno's payment forms, you will obtain the one-time token, a required parameter to create a payment using the Yuno API.\n\nThe one-time token will be shared by Yuno using the `callbackOTT` function you provided in Step 6 when initiating the payment. The one-time token will be available in the `onActivityResult`.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Loader Configuration\n>\n> While Yuno receives the customer information and shares the one-time token, a loader can be displayed to improve the user experience. Yuno provides a default loader that can be used out of the box. However, merchants may choose to implement their own loader and are responsible for making the necessary configurations.\n\n## Step 8: Create the payment\n\nAfter receiving the one-time token from [Step 7](/docs/full-checkout-android#step-7-get-the-one-time-token-ott), create the payment using the [Create payment endpoint](/reference/create-payment). Use the `checkout_session` from [Step 3](/docs/full-checkout-android#step-3-create-the-checkout-session) and the one-time token to create the payment.\n\nThe response from the Create payment endpoint will include the parameter `sdk_action_required`, which defines if additional actions are required to finish the payment based on the payment type.\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Continue Payment Method Integration\n>\n> Yuno **requires** you integrate the `continuePayment` method of the SDK after the payment is created because certain asynchronous payment methods require additional customer action to complete. The API will inform you of this scenario via the `sdk_action_required` field of the response, which will be returned as true. The `yuno.continuePayment()` function will display additional screens to customers, where they can carry out the necessary actions to complete the payment without you needing to handle every scenario.\n\n## Step 9: Continue payment\n\nYuno requires integrating the SDK's `continuePayment` method after the payment is created, as certain asynchronous payment methods require additional customer actions to complete. The response from the [Create payment endpoint](/reference/create-payment), from Step 8, will include a `sdk_action_required` field. If it returns `TRUE`, you need to call the `continuePayment()` function to show additional screens that allow the customer to complete the payment. Otherwise, this step is not necessary. Call the `continuePayment` method:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\ncontinuePayment(\n    showPaymentStatus: Boolean = true,\n    checkoutSession: String? = null,\n    countryCode: String? = null,\n    callbackPaymentState: ((String?) -> Unit)? = null\n)\n```\n\nTo show your payment status screens, send `FALSE` in the `showPaymentStatus` parameter. Then, get the payment state by callback.\n\n## Render Mode integration\n\nThe Yuno SDK render mode provides advanced UI flexibility, allowing developers to integrate payment flows with complete control over the user interface while maintaining full SDK functionality. This mode returns fragments that can be used with both Jetpack Compose and traditional XML views.\n\n### Main function: `startPaymentRender`\n\nThe `startPaymentRender` function initializes the payment flow in render mode, giving you granular control over UI presentation.\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nfun Activity.startPaymentRender(\n    checkoutSession: String? = null,\n    countryCode: String? = null,\n    coroutineScope: CoroutineScope,\n    paymentSelected: PaymentSelected,\n    listener: YunoPaymentRenderListener,\n): YunoPaymentFragmentController\n```\n\n#### Parameters\n\n| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `checkoutSession` | `String?` | No | ID of the previously created checkout session |\n| `countryCode` | `String?` | No | Country code for regional configurations |\n| `coroutineScope` | `CoroutineScope` | Yes | Coroutine scope for asynchronous operations |\n| `paymentSelected` | `PaymentSelected` | Yes | Selected payment method |\n| `listener` | `YunoPaymentRenderListener` | Yes | Listener implementation to receive events |\n\n### Implementation example\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nclass PaymentActivity : Activity() {\n\n    private lateinit var fragmentController: YunoPaymentFragmentController\n\n    private fun initializePayment() {\n        fragmentController = startPaymentRender(\n            checkoutSession = \"your_checkout_session_id\",\n            countryCode = \"US\",\n            coroutineScope = lifecycleScope,\n            paymentSelected = PaymentSelected.CARD,\n            listener = paymentRenderListener\n        )\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### `YunoPaymentRenderListener` interface\n\nImplement this interface to receive all events and views from the SDK during the payment flow:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nclass PaymentRenderListener : YunoPaymentRenderListener {\n\n    override fun showView(fragment: Fragment) {\n        supportFragmentManager.beginTransaction()\n            .replace(R.id.payment_container, fragment)\n            .commit()\n    }\n\n    override fun returnStatus(resultCode: Int, paymentStatus: String) {\n        when (paymentStatus) {\n            \"SUCCEEDED\" -> handleSuccessfulPayment()\n            \"FAIL\" -> handleFailedPayment()\n        }\n    }\n\n    override fun returnOneTimeToken(oneTimeToken: String, additionalData: OneTimeTokenModel?) {\n        createPaymentInBackend(oneTimeToken) { result ->\n            when (result) {\n                is Success -> fragmentController.continuePayment()\n                is Error -> handlePaymentError(result.error)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    override fun loadingListener(isLoading: Boolean) {\n        progressBar.visibility = if (isLoading) View.VISIBLE else View.GONE\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### `YunoPaymentFragmentController` interface\n\nControl the payment flow using the returned controller instance:\n\n#### Methods\n\n* **`submitForm()`**: Submits the current form when available\n* **`continuePayment()`**: Continues the payment flow after backend OTT processing\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nfragmentController.submitForm()\n\nfragmentController.continuePayment()\n```\n\n### Integration benefits\n\n#### UI flexibility\n\n* **Compose and XML compatible**: Works with both Jetpack Compose and traditional XML views\n* **Complete control**: You decide where and how to display each view\n* **Custom integration**: Easy integration with existing app design\n\n#### Flow control\n\n* **Custom submit logic**: Control when to submit forms\n* **Backend integration**: Process OTT on your backend before continuing\n\n### Complete integration example\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nclass PaymentActivity : ComponentActivity() {\n\n    private lateinit var fragmentController: YunoPaymentFragmentController\n\n    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)\n\n        fragmentController = startPaymentRender(\n            checkoutSession = checkoutSessionId,\n            countryCode = \"US\",\n            coroutineScope = lifecycleScope,\n            paymentSelected = PaymentSelected.CARD,\n            listener = object : YunoPaymentRenderListener {\n                override fun showView(fragment: Fragment) {\n                    supportFragmentManager.beginTransaction()\n                        .replace(R.id.payment_fragment_container, fragment)\n                        .commit()\n                }\n\n                override fun returnOneTimeToken(oneTimeToken: String, additionalData: OneTimeTokenModel?) {\n                    processPaymentToken(oneTimeToken) {\n                        fragmentController.continuePayment()\n                    }\n                }\n\n                override fun returnStatus(resultCode: Int, paymentStatus: String) {\n                    handlePaymentResult(paymentStatus)\n                }\n\n                override fun loadingListener(isLoading: Boolean) {\n                    updateLoadingState(isLoading)\n                }\n            }\n        )\n    }\n}\n```\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Lifecycle Management\n>\n> Ensure that the `CoroutineScope` is tied to the Activity/Fragment lifecycle to prevent memory leaks and ensure proper cleanup.\n\n## Complementary features\n\nThe Yuno Android SDK provides additional services and configurations you can use to improve the customer experience. Use the [SDK customizations](/docs/sdk-customizations-android) to change the SDK appearance to match your brand or to configure the loader:\n\n### Click to Pay (CTP) with Passkey\n\nUnlike other processes, when a user completes a payment using CTP Passkey, the *One-Time Token* (`OTT`) will not be received through the usual callback methods. The OTT will be delivered via the **deeplink URL** in the Intent. Your app must read it from the `Intent`, create the payment on your backend, and then continue the flow with the SDK.\n\n#### 1. AndroidManifest (deeplink)\n\nAdd an `intent-filter` to your main activity in `AndroidManifest.xml`:\n\nXML\n\n```\n<activity android:name=\".CheckoutActivity\" android:exported=\"true\">\n  <intent-filter>\n    <action android:name=\"android.intent.action.VIEW\" />\n    <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.DEFAULT\" />\n    <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.BROWSABLE\" />\n    <!-- Adjust to your actual scheme/host -->\n    <data android:scheme=\"myapp\" android:host=\"pay\" android:pathPrefix=\"/ctp\" />\n  </intent-filter>\n</activity>\n```\n\nAdjust the `scheme`, `host`, and `pathPrefix` to match your app's configuration.\n\n#### 2. Handle the Intent\n\nIn your activity, handle the Intent in both `onCreate()` and `onNewIntent()`:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nclass CheckoutActivity : AppCompatActivity() {\n    \n    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)\n        initYuno()\n        startCheckout()\n        // Initialize your SDK / UI\n        handleDeeplink(intent)\n    }\n\n    override fun onNewIntent(intent: Intent) {\n        super.onNewIntent(intent)\n        setIntent(intent)\n        handleDeeplink(intent)\n    }\n\n    private fun handleDeeplink(intent: Intent?) {\n        val uri = intent?.data ?: return\n\n        when {\n            // Cancellation or error\n            uri.getBooleanQueryParameter(\"has_error\", false) -> {\n                val message = uri.getQueryParameter(\"message\") ?: \"Operation canceled\"\n                showError(message)\n            }\n\n            // Success: OTT received in URL\n            uri.getQueryParameter(\"one_time_token\") != null -> {\n                val ott = extractOtt(uri) ?: return\n                val checkoutSession = extractCheckoutSession(uri)\n\n                // 1) Send the OTT to your backend to create the payment\n                createPaymentOnBackend(ott) { success ->\n                    if (success && checkoutSession != null) {\n                        // 2) Then continue the flow in the SDK\n                        continuePayment(\n                            checkoutSession = checkoutSession,\n                            countryCode = currentCountry\n                        ) { result ->\n                            // Handle payment state\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    private fun extractOtt(uri: Uri): String? =\n        uri.getQueryParameter(\"one_time_token\")\n\n    private fun extractCheckoutSession(uri: Uri): String? =\n        uri.getQueryParameter(\"checkout_session\")\n            ?: uri.getQueryParameter(\"checkoutSession\")\n}\n```\n\n#### 3. Create the Payment (Backend)\n\nOnce you extract the **OTT** from the deeplink, create the payment on your backend using the [Create Payment endpoint](/reference/create-payment).\n\nAfter receiving a successful response from your backend (payment created), continue the flow in the SDK by calling `continuePayment()`.\n\n#### 4. Helper Functions\n\nCreate helper functions to extract parameters from the Intent URI:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nprivate fun extractOtt(uri: Uri): String? =\n    uri.getQueryParameter(\"one_time_token\")\n\nprivate fun extractCheckoutSession(uri: Uri): String? =\n    uri.getQueryParameter(\"checkout_session\")\n        ?: uri.getQueryParameter(\"checkoutSession\")\n```\n\n> 💡\n>\n> ### Tip\n>\n> In QA environments, log the complete URL to verify the parameter names.\n\n#### 5. Quick Testing\n\nYou can test the CTP Passkey flow using these sample deeplink URLs:\n\n* **Success:** `myapp://pay/ctp?one_time_token=OTT_123&checkout_session=CHK_456`\n* **Error:** `myapp://pay/ctp?has_error=true&message=User%20canceled`\n* **Continuation:** `myapp://pay/ctp`\n\n#### 6. Checklist\n\nUse this checklist to ensure proper CTP Passkey integration:\n\n* ✅ `intent-filter` configured correctly (scheme/host/path)\n* ✅ `handleDeeplink` implemented in both `onCreate()` and `onNewIntent()`\n* ✅ Extract both `one_time_token` and `checkout_session` parameters\n* ✅ Create payment on backend with **OTT** ➜ call `continuePayment(...)`\n* ✅ Handle `has_error` and `message` parameters for error scenarios\n\n> ⚠️\n>\n> ### Important\n>\n> The OTT will **not** be received through the `callbackOTT` function for CTP Passkey payments. You must extract the token from the Intent URI parameters instead.\n\n### `styles`\n\nWith the `styles` customization option, you can define global visual styles through a `YunoStyles` object. It lets you apply consistent branding across the SDK by customizing button appearance and typography.\n\nKotlin\n\n```\ndata class YunoStyles(\n    val buttonStyles: YunoButtonStyles? = null,\n    val fontFamily: FontFamily? = null\n)\n```\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `buttonStyles` | Customizes the primary buttons displayed in the SDK. |\n| `fontFamily` | Sets the font family used across all SDK text elements. |\n\nThe `YunoButtonStyles` object lets you define specific settings for button appearance:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\ndata class YunoButtonStyles(\n    val backgroundColor: Color? = null,\n    val contentColor: Color? = null,\n    val cornerRadius: Dp? = null,\n    val elevation: Dp? = null,\n    val padding: Dp? = null,\n    val fontFamily: FontFamily? = null,\n    val fontSize: TextUnit? = null,\n    val fontStyle: FontStyle? = null\n)\n```\n\nTo use the `styles` customization option, use the `YunoConfig` data class, described in Step 2.\n\n### Loader\n\nThe loader functionality is controlled through the `keepLoader` parameter in the `YunoConfig` data class, which is documented inline in the SDK configuration section above.\n\n### Save card for future payments\n\nYou can display a checkbox to save or enroll cards using `cardSaveEnable: true`. The following examples show the checkbox for both card form renders:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/bc488803d0318c28987b6db6fc68652ffaea43dbbd456e8dada33f7cdd472030-Card___save_for_future_payments.png)\n\n### Render options\n\nYou can choose between two card form render options. The following screenshots show the difference between `cardFormType` `ONE_STEP` and `STEP_BY_STEP`:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/2b2b5c5c798e57c561beb5cf3e7711e83928de826c2922cd8262b4459c6e1737-Full_SDK_android.png)\n\n### SDK customizations\n\nYou can change the SDK appearance to match your brand.

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/card-verification", "title": "Card Verification", "content_markdown": "# Card Verification\n\nYuno lets you verify if the customer's credit card is real and is working. Our Credit Card Verification API is designed to empower your applications with a robust mechanism for validating credit card transactions, ensuring a seamless and secure payment experience for your users. This operation does not create any charges for your client.\n\n## Advantages\n\nWith the Yuno card verification service, you can protect your business in real time:\n\n* **Real-time Verification**: Instantly validate credit card details to ensure accuracy and authenticity.\n* **Fraud Prevention**: Mitigate the risk of fraudulent transactions by verifying the legitimacy of credit card information.\n* **Seamless Integration**: Easily integrate our API into your existing payment processing system, minimizing development time and effort.\n\n## Integration\n\nFirst, you need to define a route to use the card verification feature. When configuring the route, be sure to select:\n\n* **Card** as payment method.\n* Define the **Transaction type** **Equal** to **VERIFY**.\n\nWith the above configurations, all card verifications will be processed following the configuration of the created route.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/ace8dd6aa4d7fe71f02ae0600949b59d8d59bfb329d55e66134a858fc7ea4a33-Screenshot_2024-10-14_at_3.09.35_PM.png)\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Select the Correct Provider\n>\n> * The credit card verification process isn't provided by all providers. Always contact your technical account manager to verify which providers support card verification.\n> * Yuno uses a zero-dollar authorization for card validations. If the provider does not support this flow, we will internally:\n>   + Authorize the minimum possible amount and then cancel the authorization for credit cards.\n>   + Perform a purchase for the minimum possible amount and then refund it for debit cards.\n\nIn addition to creating the route, you need to choose when to use the validation. You can verify cards during the [enrollment process](/reference/enroll-payment-method-checkout) or while making a credit [card payment](/reference/create-payment). Depending on your chosen process, you should use different endpoints or SDK functions.\n\n### Verify the card at the enrollment\n\nYou can verify the card at the enrollment whether you are using the Direct or SDK integrations.\n\n#### SDK integration\n\nIf you are using an integration based on SDKs, you need to define the `verify` object, informing the `currency` and `vault_on_success = true` when performing the enrollment. The code block below presents an example of card verification requests and responses using the SDK.\n\nRequest\n\n```\n{\n  \"payment_method_type\": \"CARD\",\n\t\"country\":\"DE\",\n\t\"account_id\":\"493e9374-510a-4201-9e09-de669d75f256\",\n    \"verify\": {\n        \"vault_on_success\": true,\n        \"currency\": \"EUR\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nResponse\n\n```\n{\n    \"id\": \"fbc68364-0456-41b6-9743-1acb07d55f14\",\n    \"idempotency_key\": null,\n    \"account_id\": \"493e9374-510a-4201-9e09-de669d75f256\",\n    \"name\": \"Card\",\n    \"description\": \"Card\",\n    \"type\": \"CARD\",\n    \"category\": \"CARD\",\n    \"country\": \"BR\",\n    \"status\": \"READY_TO_ENROLL\",\n    \"created_at\": \"2024-01-31T14:44:33.552281Z\",\n    \"updated_at\": \"2024-01-31T14:44:33.552283Z\",\n    \"enrollment\": {\n        \"session\": \"232b123d-c4d9-4ddc-b776-e0b0eaa6bb8b\",\n        \"sdk_required_action\": true\n    },\n    \"provider\": {\n        \"id\": \"YUNO\",\n        \"type\": \"YUNO\",\n        \"provider_status\": null\n    },\n    \"customer_payer\": {\n        \"first_name\": \"Fernando\",\n        \"last_name\": \"Iglesias\",\n        \"email\": \"[email protected]\",\n        \"gender\": null,\n        \"date_of_birth\": null,\n        \"document\": null,\n        \"phone\": null,\n        \"billing_address\": null\n    },\n    \"verify\": {\n        \"vault_on_success\": true,\n        \"currency\": \"BRL\",\n        \"payment\": null\n    },\n    \"preferred\": null\n}\n```\n\nAccess the [SDK integration](/reference/enroll-payment-method-checkout) page for additional information related to the enrollment process.\n\n#### Direct integration\n\nTo verify the card at the enrollment with the Direct integration, you will use the [Enroll Payment Method](/reference/enroll-payment-method-api) endpoint. In addition to the `card_data` object, you need to provide the `verify`object. Inside of the `verify` object you define the `currency` and provide `vault_on_success = true`. The code block below presents an example of card verification requests and responses using the [Enroll Payment Method](/reference/enroll-payment-method-api).\n\nRequest\n\n```\n{\n    \"account_id\": \"493e9374-510a-4201-9e09-de669d75f256\",\n    \"country\": \"DE\",\n    \"type\": \"CARD\",\n    \"workflow\": \"DIRECT\",\n    \"card_data\": {\n        \"holder_name\": \"John Smith\",\n

the card at the payment\n\nIf you want to verify the card using a payment operation, you need to fulfill two requirements:\n\n* Inform `amount.value=0`.\n* Add `verify = true` inside of the `payment_method.detail.card.` object.\n\nFollowing the above instructions, the resulting operation won't result in any charges for your client.\n\n#### SDK integration\n\nThe code block below presents

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/connections", "title": "Connections", "content_markdown": "# Connections\n\nThe Connections section within the dashboard enables you to integrate and manage various providers, including payment methods, payment processors, and anti-fraud solutions. The ability to connect with providers from around the world using Yuno greatly reduces integration times and brings additional functionalities to your customers, increasing conveniency and revenue.\n\nLet's walk through the process of adding, creating, and managing connections to enhance your payment processing and routing capabilities.\n\n## Adding a connection\n\n1. The **Explore** tab will display by default when opening Connections in the dashboard. From here, browse through the list of available providers or use the **Search** box to find your desired connection. Providers may include payment methods, processors, and anti-fraud solutions. Click **Connect** to proceed.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/58912e88e076fb19b2d3270d9c014997fb701da710ce2ab95371cd339f4d85ca-Conections.png)\n\n2. After selecting a provider, you will start the quick three-step process to configure the connection. First, you will be asked for provider credentials, necessary to establish a secure connection. Enter a memorable name for the connection and then enter the details required. The specific information you must enter will vary by provider, though you'll most likely have this data beforehand. Feel free to reach out to the provider in case you're unsure about any of these fields or missing information. Optionally, you may check **3DS Credentials** and enter the required data to activate the feature. Click **Next**.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/b83119ee6039bf9acdcbfd663efa5cba83e5636e850242ad805f7d11c6f47d8a-Conections_1.png)\n\n3. The next screen, **Set up costs**, will let you enter cost information to use in Smart Routing. Select **Set up cost** to enter costs for successful and unsuccessful payments. This option is entirely optional, so you may click **Next** without entering data.\n4. **Set up accounts** lets you select the accounts that will be affected by the changes. Check specific accounts or **Current account only** and click **Save** to finish. The system will confirm the connection has been created, establishing a bridge between your Yuno account and the chosen provider.\n5. With your connections set, you can proceed to the [Routing](../docs/routing) section to configure payment processing routes using the provider and payment methods you have available within Yuno.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Set up costs for new connections\n>\n> When you add a new connection, you can set up its costs. This optional step allows you to set different costs for successful and unsuccessful payments to help manage fees using the [Smart Routing feature](../docs/routing#smart-routing).\n>\n> You can set default costs for all payments and add specific conditions for different situations, like setting a unique cost when a customer uses Visa.\n>\n> Costs are applied in the order you create them, but you can rearrange them by dragging and dropping. This setup helps Yuno Payments automatically choose the most cost-effective route for each transaction when you activate the Smart Routing.\n\n## Managing connections\n\nThe **Your connections** tab within Connections allows you to manage existing connections to suit your evolving business needs. Available actions include:\n\n* **Editing connections**: Easily update credentials or change a connection's settings by selecting the three dots next to the connection and selecting **Edit**.\n* **Pausing and unpausing connections**: To temporarily halt the interaction with a specific provider, you can choose to **Pause** a connection. When ready to resume, simply **Unpause** it. This flexibility allows you to adapt to changing circumstances without having to redo your connections.\n* **Deleting connections**: If a connection is no longer needed, you can delete it. Exercise caution when deleting connections, as this action is irreversible.\n* **Managing multiple connections**: Check the box next to two or more connections to pause, unpause and delete connections in bulk.\n\n## Dynamic Metadata Configuration\n\nThe Dynamic Metadata feature allows you to control which metadata fields are sent to each connected provider, giving you granular control over your payment data flow.\n\nWith this feature, you can configure exactly which metadata keys should be sent to each specific provider directly from your connection settings.\n\nUse Dynamic Metadata when you need to send different metadata to different providers based on their requirements.\n\nTo use Dynamic Metadata:\n\n1. Turn on the \"Dynamic Metadata Configuration\" flag in your connection settings.\n2. Set up key mappings from your public API metadata to provider-specific metadata.\n3. Only the configured metadata keys will be sent to the provider during transactions.\n\n> ⚠️\n>\n> ### **Important for Stripe users**\n>\n> The current metadata logic in Stripe will be removed on **August 29, 2025**. Make sure to update your connection to use dynamic mapping before this date to avoid any disruption to your payment processing.\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Home](/docs/your-payment-operative-system)[Routing](/docs/routing)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Adding a connection](#adding-a-connection)\n  + [Managing connections](#managing-connections)\n  + [Dynamic Metadata Configuration](#dynamic-metadata-configuration)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/58912e88e076fb19b2d3270d9c014997fb701da710ce2ab95371cd339f4d85ca-Conections.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/58912e88e076fb19b2d3270d9c014997fb701da710ce2ab95371cd339f4d85ca-Conections.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the dashboard screen showing the dashboards and dashboards of the app"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/b83119ee6039bf9acdcbfd663efa5cba83e5636e850242ad805f7d11c6f47d8a-Conections_1.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/b83119ee6039bf9acdcbfd663efa5cba83e5636e850242ad805f7d11c6f47d8a-Conections_1.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the google account screen with the account button highlighted"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}
{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/external-browser-callback-android", "title": "Handle External Browser Return (callback_url)", "content_markdown": "# Handle External Browser Return (callback\\_url)\n\n## Overview\n\nWhen a payment flow requires the user to complete an action in an external browser (e.g., 3DS challenge, bank redirect), it is essential to use the `callback_url` parameter to ensure the user returns to your app seamlessly.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Set the callback\\_url when creating the checkout session\n\nSend the `callback_url` parameter when creating the checkout session:\n\nJSON\n\n```\n{\n  \"callback_url\": \"myapp://return\"\n}\n```\n\n> ❗️\n>\n> ### Important\n>\n> Without `callback_url`, the user may be left in the browser with no way to return to your app.\n\n## 2. Configure your Android app to handle the deep link\n\nAdd an `intent-filter` to your main activity in `AndroidManifest.xml`:\n\nXML\n\n```\n<activity android:name=\".YourMainActivity\">\n    <intent-filter android:autoVerify=\"true\">\n        <action android:name=\"android.intent.action.VIEW\" />\n        <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.DEFAULT\" />\n        <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.BROWSABLE\" />\n        <data\n            android:scheme=\"myapp\"\n            android:host=\"return\" />\n    </intent-filter>\n</activity>\n```\n\n* The scheme (`myapp`) and host (`return`) must match your `callback_url`\n\n## 3. Handle the intent in your activity\n\nIn your activity, handle the return intent:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nintent.data?.let { uri ->\n    val url = uri.toString()\n    if (url.contains(\"myapp://return\")) {\n        // Handle the return, e.g., show a message or navigate\n        Toast.makeText(this, \"Returned from payment flow\", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()\n    }\n}\n```\n\n* Adapt this logic to your app's needs\n\n## 4. Full example: integrating with Yuno SDK\n\nKotlin\n\n```\noverride fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)\n\n    startCheckout(\n        callbackPaymentState = {\n            Toast.makeText(this, it, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()\n        }\n    )\n\n    if (intent?.data != null) {\n        intent.data?.let {\n            if (it.toString().contains(URI_INTENT_CONTINUE)) {\n                val sessionId = extractCheckoutSessionFromIntent(intent)\n\n                continuePayment(\n                    showPaymentStatus = configuration.showStatusYuno,\n                    checkoutSession = sessionId,\n                    countryCode = configuration.country,\n                ) { result ->\n                    result?.let {\n                        Toast.makeText(this, it, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    } else {\n        setContent {\n            YunoContent(configuration) {\n                initYuno()\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nprivate fun extractCheckoutSessionFromIntent(intent: Intent?): String? {\n    return intent?.data?.getQueryParameter(\"checkoutSession\")\n}\n```\n\n## Best practices\n\n* Always define and use `callback_url` in your payment flows\n* Configure the `intent-filter` correctly in your manifest\n* Handle the return intent to update the payment status or navigate the user\n* Test the flow on multiple devices and browsers\n\n## Summary\n\n* Use `callback_url` to ensure users return to your app\n* Configure deep link handling in Android\n* Handle the intent to complete the payment flow\n\nUpdated 5 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Card Scanning (OCR)](/docs/card-scanning-ocr-android)[iOS SDKs](/docs/ios-sdk-integrations)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Overview](#overview)\n  + [1.

For detailed instructions, check out the [official VTEX documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/setting-up-merchant-id-in-apple-pay).\n\nIn the Apple Developer dashboard:\n\n1. Log in to [Apple Developer](https://idmsa.apple.com/IDMSWebAuth/signin?appIdKey=891bd3417a7776362562d2197f89480a8547b108fd934911bcbea0110d07f757&path=%2Faccount%2F&rv=1), go to **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles**, then select **Register a new identifier**.\n2. Choose **Merchant IDs**.\n3. Enter a **Description** (e.g., `Apple Pay Integration`) and an **Identifier** in the format `merchant.com.y.uno.YourBusinessName`.\n\n## Step 2: Generate a payment processing certificate\n\n1. Create a new directory (e.g., `Downloads/ApplePayFiles`) to store the certificate files.\n2. Open **Keychain Access** on your Mac.\n3. Go to **Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority**.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/e8dc051-image_1.png)\n\n4. Fill out the form:\n\n   * **Email Address**: your email address\n   * **Common Name**: a name for the certificate (e.g., `John Doe ProcessingCertificate`)\n   * **CA Email Address**: leave blank\n   * Select **Saved to disk**\n   * Check **Let me specify key pair information**\n5. Click **Continue**, then save the file as `CertificateSigningRequestPaymentProcessingCertificate.certSigningRequest` in your working directory.\n6. When prompted for key pair settings, use:\n\n   * **Key Type**: Elliptic Curve (EC)\n   * **Key Size**: 256-bit\n   * **Algorithm**: ECDSA\n\n## Step 3: Retrieve and convert the payment processing certificate\n\n1. Go to the [Apple Developer Merchant ID list](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/merchant).\n2. Select your Merchant ID and click **Create Certificate** under **Apple Pay Payment Processing Certificate**.\n3. When prompted, answer **No** to \"Will payments... be processed exclusively in China mainland?\"\n4. Upload the file `CertificateSigningRequestPaymentProcessingCertificate.certSigningRequest`.\n5. Download the signed certificate as `apple_pay.cer` and save it to your directory.\n6. Convert the certificate to PEM format:\n\nBash\n\n```\nopenssl x509 -inform DER -in apple_pay.cer -out apple_pay.pem\n```\n\n## Step 4: Export the private key\n\n1. In **Keychain Access**, find the key you created (e.g., `John Doe ProcessingCertificate`).\n2. Right-click and choose **Export**.\n3. Export the key as a `.p12` file (e.g., `JohnDoeProcessingCertificate.p12`) and save it to your working directory.\n4. Set a strong password (you’ll use it in the next step).\n5. Convert the `.p12` to a PEM-format private key:\n\nBash\n\n```\nopenssl pkcs12 -in JohnDoeProcessingCertificate.p12 -nocerts -nodes | sed -ne '/-BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-/,/-END PRIVATE KEY-/p' > ProcessingCertificatePrivateKey.pem\n```\n\nThe private key will be stored in `ProcessingCertificatePrivateKey.pem`.\n\n## Step 5: Upload the certificate and key to Yuno\n\n1. Open the [Yuno Dashboard](https://auth.y.uno/u/login) **> Connections > Apple Pay > Connect**\n2.

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/headless-sdk-integration", "title": "Headless SDK (Payment)", "content_markdown": "# Headless SDK (Payment)\n\nYuno's **Headless SDK** gives you full control over the checkout UX and UI without requiring you to be PCI-compliant. With Headless SDK, you can make card payments or enroll card information into your customers' accounts. Access the [Headless SDK (Enrollment)](/docs/headless-sdk-enrollment) for more information. This page covers the payment operation. Below you can check the guides available.\n\n## Payment workflow\n\nThe diagram below illustrates the complete payment workflow. Each step is explained in detail in the following sections. For platform-specific implementation details, refer to the corresponding guide:\n\n[#### Web](../docs/headless-sdk-payment)[#### iOS](../docs/headless-sdk-payment-ios)[#### Android](../docs/headless-sdk-payment-android)\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/a17409c-Diagrama_-_SDK_Headless_pago.png)\n\n### SDK Headless Payment Flow\n\nThis diagram illustrates the headless payment process using the SDK, detailing the interactions between the Merchant Client, Merchant Server, Yuno Server, and Yuno SDK. It outlines the steps from initiating a checkout and requesting payment methods to creating and receiving the payment result.\n\n#### Merchant Client\n\nThe Merchant Client represents your frontend application that interacts with both your backend server and the Yuno SDK. It handles the user-facing aspects of the payment flow, including:\n\n* Initiate checkout\n* List payment methods\n* User selects payment methods\n* Initiate SDK with checkout session and payment method\n* Gets token (single use)\n* Initiate payment\n\n#### Merchant Server\n\nThe Merchant Server represents your backend application that handles server-side operations and communicates with Yuno's servers. Its key responsibilities include:\n\n* Create Customer\n* Create checkout session\n* Request available payment method\n* Create payment\n* Receive payment result via webhook\n\n#### Yuno Server\n\nThe Yuno Server handles all backend operations related to customer management, checkout sessions, and payment processing. Its main responsibilities include:\n\n* Creates Customer\n* Creates checkout session\n* Returns available payment method\n* Creates payment in the payment provider\n* Receive payment results from payment provider\n\n#### Yuno SDK\n\nThe Yuno SDK handles the user interface and payment flow on the client side, managing payment method selection, token generation, and payment completion. Its key responsibilities include:\n\n* Receives checkout session and payment method selected by user\n* Callback with the one-time token\n\n#### Flow\n\nThe following steps outline the complete interaction flow between all components of the SDK Headless Payment integration, detailing how each request and response moves through the system:\n\n1. Merchant Server: Create Customer --> Yuno Server: Creates Customer\n2. Merchant Client: Initiate checkout --> Merchant Server: Create checkout session\n3. Merchant Server: Create checkout session --> Yuno Server: Creates checkout session\n4. Merchant Client: List payment methods --> Merchant Server: Request available payment method\n5. Merchant Server: Request available payment method --> Yuno Server: Returns available payment method\n6. Merchant Client: List payment methods --> Merchant Client: User selects payment methods\n7. Merchant Client: User selects payment methods --> Merchant Client: Initiate SDK with checkout session and payment method\n8. Merchant Client: Initiate SDK with checkout session and payment method --> Yuno SDK: Receives checkout session and payment method selected by user\n9. Yuno SDK: Receives checkout session and payment method selected by user --> Yuno SDK: Callback with the one-time token\n10. Yuno SDK: Callback with the one-time token --> Merchant Client: Gets token (single use)\n11. Merchant Client: Gets token (single use) --> Merchant Client: Initiate payment\n12. Merchant Client: Initiate payment --> Merchant Server: Create payment\n13. Merchant Server: Create payment --> Yuno Server: Creates payment in the payment provider\n14. Merchant Server: Receive payment result via webhook --> Yuno Server: Receive payment results from payment provider\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Choose your integration\n>\n> The Headless SDK is designed to accept payments using cards only. If you need to perform a payment using another payment method, you need to choose another Yuno integration:\n>\n> * [Full SDK](../docs/secure-fields-payment)\n> * [Lite SDK](../docs/secure-fields-payment)\n> * [Direct Flow](../docs/secure-fields-payment)\n\n## Enroll a credit card while paying\n\nWith Headless SDK, you can save credit/debit cards for future purchases within the same payment request without the enrollment [integration](/docs/headless-sdk-enrollment-steps). You can obtain the [vaulted token](/docs/tokens) while executing the `apiClientPayment.generateToken` function in [Step 4](#step-4-implement-the-sdk-and-get-a-one-time-token).\n\nProvide a checkbox on your checkout for users to choose if they want to save their card for future use. If the user selects this option, set `payment_method.card.save = true` when calling the `apiClientPayment.generateToken` function. You'll receive the `vaulted_token` in the function response.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Alternative Payment Methods\n>\n> To enroll alternative payment methods, see the [Lite SDK (Enrollment)](/docs/enrollment-lite) page.\n\nAfter enrolling in a payment method, you can use the vaulted token to perform payments. To access information about the payment methods enrolled by each user, you can use one of the following endpoints:\n\n* [Get payment methods by checkout session](/reference/retrieve-payment-methods-for-checkout).\n* [Get payment methods by customer](/reference/retrieve-enrolled-payment-methods-api).\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Using a vaulted token\n>\n> Even if the user selects an enrolled payment method, Yuno recommends using the SDK to tokenize the information instead of directly using the vaulted token with Yuno's API. This approach provides several benefits:\n>\n> * **Support 3DS**: Enhanced security for online payments.\n> * **Fraud Screening**: Better protection against fraudulent transactions.\n> * **Collect Required Information**: Gather additional fields required by the provider if necessary.\n>\n> To implement this, send the `vaultedToken` when mounting the SDK. The SDK will handle the rest. If the payment method requires an extra step (such as a 3DS challenge), use the `yuno.continuePayment()` method. This method handles any required redirections and works for both enrolled and regular payment methods that need additional customer actions.\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Secure Fields](/docs/secure-fields)[Headless SDK (Enrollment)](/docs/headless-sdk-enrollment-steps)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Payment workflow](#payment-workflow)\n  + - [SDK Headless Payment Flow](#sdk-headless-payment-flow)\n  + [Enroll a credit card while paying](#enroll-a-credit-card-while-paying)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/a17409c-Diagrama_-_SDK_Headless_pago.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/a17409c-Diagrama_-_SDK_Headless_pago.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a diagram showing the different types of the system"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}
{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/payment-status", "title": "Payment Status", "content_markdown": "# Payment Status\n\nTo monitor payments, you can use one of the monitoring status solutions provided by Yuno. You can use one of two options:\n\n* **Status**: You can use the Status SDK to update the user about the payment process. It provides visual information for customers.\n* **Status Lite**: You can use the Status Lite SDK to get info about the current payment status. However, the Status Lite does not mount any element.\n\nBoth solutions initialize the same way. After adding the Yuno SDK to your system and creating an instance, see the desired status solution to learn how to use it.\n\n## Step 1: Include the library in your project.\n\nEnsure the Yuno SDK file is included in your webpage before closing the `<body>` tag. See the example below:\n\nHTML\n\n```\n<script src=\"https://sdk-web.y.uno/v1.1/main.js\"></script>\n```\n\n## Step 2: Initialize SDK with the public key\n\nIn your JavaScript application, create an instance of the `Yuno` class by providing a valid **PUBLIC\\_API\\_KEY**. See the [Get your API credentials](/reference/developers-credentials) guide.\n\nLike the example below, use the initialized class that is attributed to the `yuno` constant:\n\nHTML\n\n```\n<script src=\"https://sdk-web.y.uno/v1.1/main.js\"></script>\n```\n\nOnce you create the instance, choose between using the Status or Status Lite solutions to access the payment status.\n\n## Step 3: Use Status\n\nTo use the Status, you need to mount it. Use the `mountStatusPayment` function to define the `checkoutSession` related to the payment, the `countryCode`, the `language`, and the callback `yunoPaymentResult`.\n\nThe callback will be executed when the status is received, informing the user. Defining the element to mount the Status is unnecessary since it will cover the entire screen. The following code block shows an example of the parameter configuration:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyuno.mountStatusPayment({\n  checkoutSession: '438413b7-4921-41e4-b8f3-28a5a0141638',\n  countryCode: 'FR',\n  language: 'fr',\n  yunoPaymentResult(data) {\n    console.log('yunoPaymentResult', data)\n  }\n})\n```\n\n### Parameters\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `checkoutSession` | The checkout session ID for the payment you want to monitor |\n| `countryCode` | The country code for the payment process. See [Country Coverage](/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk) for supported countries |\n| `language` | Language for the status display. Supported options: en, fr, jp |\n| `yunoPaymentResult` | Callback function that receives the payment status. The data parameter can be: 'READY\\_TO\\_PAY', 'CREATED', 'SUCCEEDED', 'REJECTED', 'CANCELLED', 'ERROR', 'DECLINED', 'PENDING', 'EXPIRED', 'VERIFIED', 'REFUNDED' |\n\n### Use Status Lite\n\nTo receive the current payment status using Status Lite, you need to call the method `yunoPaymentResult` providing the `checkoutSession` related to the payment, as shown in the example below:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst status = await yuno.yunoPaymentResult(checkoutSession)\n```\n\nThe `yunoPaymentResult` method returns the current payment status without rendering any UI elements. The returned status can be one of the following values:\n\n* `READY_TO_PAY`\n* `CREATED`\n* `SUCCEEDED`\n* `REJECTED`\n* `CANCELLED`\n* `ERROR`\n* `DECLINED`\n* `PENDING`\n* `EXPIRED`\n* `VERIFIED`\n* `REFUNDED`\n\n> 👍\n>\n> ### Custom Payment Status Integration\n>\n> If you prefer to use your own custom Payment Status page instead of personalizing the one provided by our SDK, you can do so by editing the HTML file to connect to an edited `status-lite.js` script. This allows you to fully customize the appearance and behavior of the payment status display while still using Yuno's status functionality. For example, after calling the `yunoPaymentResult` function, you can handle the status result in your own version of the `status-lite.js` script, which will then update your custom HTML file.\n\n## Stay Updated\n\nVisit the [changelog](/changelog) for the latest SDK updates and version history.\n\nUpdated about 1 month ago\n\n---\n\n[Headless SDK (Payment Web)](/docs/headless-sdk-payment)[SDK Customizations](/docs/sdk-customizations)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Step 1: Include the library in your project.](#step-1-include-the-library-in-your-project)\n  + [Step 2: Initialize SDK with the public key](#step-2-initialize-sdk-with-the-public-key)\n  + [Step 3: Use Status](#step-3-use-status)\n  + - [Parameters](#parameters)\n    - [Use Status Lite](#use-status-lite)\n  + [Stay Updated](#stay-updated)", "images": [], "source": "Yuno Docs"}
{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/reconciliations", "title": "Reconciliations", "content_markdown": "# Reconciliations\n\nReconciliation is a process that compares your transactions with settlement documents from payment providers to:\n\n* Identify and resolve discrepancies\n* Ensure all processed transactions are properly settled\n* Maintain accurate financial records\n\nThe reconciliation process works by:\n\n1. Collecting settlement files from each payment provider\n2. Comparing those files with transactions processed through Yuno\n3. Checking account balances with your acquirers\n4. Verifying all records are accurate, consistent and up-to-date\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/3f66c409f3e0afed83ab7829398e5d88abb6696e587d3b1e32909f496400ba91-Reconciliations.png)\n\n## Why reconciliation matters\n\nReconciliation helps you identify and resolve discrepancies in your payment processing. While some discrepancies are harmless, factors like payment timing, deposits, and pending transactions can affect your bank account balances. Regular reconciliation allows you to:\n\n* Detect and prevent balance errors\n* Identify potential fraud\n* Track failed payments\n* Ensure accurate financial records\n\nThe key objectives of reconciliation are to:\n\n* Verify that merchants receive all payments from successful Yuno transactions\n* Ensure compliance with payment terms between merchants and acquirers\n* Monitor acquisition processing costs and validate them against agreed terms\n* Maintain data integrity and accurate transaction states in the Yuno dashboard\n\nFor best results, perform reconciliation daily. If daily reconciliation isn't feasible, aim to reconcile weekly or at minimum monthly.\n\n## How Yuno facilitates reconciliation\n\nYuno provides a comprehensive transaction reconciliation process that helps you:\n\n* Ensure proper payment accreditation\n* Verify compliance with payment terms\n* Track processing costs\n\nOur system orchestrates and manages data from Yuno, partners, and merchants to execute accurate reconciliation.\n\n### Reconciliation status\n\nEach transaction can have one of the following reconciliation statuses:\n\n| Status | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Reconciled | The transaction was found in the provider's settlement and will be credited to your bank account |\n| Non reconcilable | The transaction cannot be reconciled as it doesn't meet reconciliation criteria. No further action will be taken |\n| Not reconciled | The transaction is pending identification in a settlement. Check the sub-status to see if it's still within payment terms |\n| Conflict | A matching transaction was found in the settlement but has discrepancies with the processed record |\n\n### State machine\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/97f552819f904bc8f051368a96b35d3736028a84fce9fc4be65e08ef3811df5a-report_reconciliation3_1.png)\n\n### Reports\n\nYuno provides two reconciliation reports:\n\n1. **Transaction reconciliation report**\n\n   * Shows reconciliation status and sub-status\n   * Includes reconciliation ID for each transaction\n2. **Settlement report**\n\n   * Lists all transactions in bank transfers to your account\n   * Includes reconciliation details for each transaction\n\nUpdated 6 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Insights](/docs/insights)[Developers (Credentials)](/docs/developers-credentials)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Why reconciliation matters](#why-reconciliation-matters)\n  + [How Yuno facilitates reconciliation](#how-yuno-facilitates-reconciliation)\n  + - [Reconciliation status](#reconciliation-status)\n    - [State machine](#state-machine)\n    - [Reports](#reports)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/3f66c409f3e0afed83ab7829398e5d88abb6696e587d3b1e32909f496400ba91-Reconciliations.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/3f66c409f3e0afed83ab7829398e5d88abb6696e587d3b1e32909f496400ba91-Reconciliations.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the dashboard screen showing the dashboards and dashboards of the dashboard"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/97f552819f904bc8f051368a96b35d3736028a84fce9fc4be65e08ef3811df5a-report_reconciliation3_1.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/97f552819f904bc8f051368a96b35d3736028a84fce9fc4be65e08ef3811df5a-report_reconciliation3_1.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a diagram showing the different types of the different types of the system"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/chargeback-management", "title": "Chargeback Management", "content_markdown": "# Chargeback Management\n\nYuno offers a unified and automated solution for handling disputes, allowing you to manage chargebacks across all providers from a single dashboard. Our platform helps you automate workflows, recover revenue, and stay audit-ready, all without the back and forth.\n\n## What is a Chargeback?\n\nA chargeback is a claim initiated by a customer through their issuing bank due to a transaction they find problematic, such as unauthorized payments, incorrect amounts, or merchant disputes.\n\nIn Yuno, a **chargeback** and a **dispute** are technically the same—they both represent a contested transaction.  \nThe conceptual difference lies in the merchant's response: when a merchant provides documentation to contest the chargeback, it becomes an **active dispute**. However, the transaction remains the same, and only its state evolves based on the actions taken.\n\n## Chargeback Workflow\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/e0034ded51f79400bd4698b840ec6c77237938e13ea3db078ae959c94d05f375-Chargebacks_disputes.png)\n\n1. **Chargeback creation**\n\n   * The customer raises a claim with their issuing bank\n   * The bank notifies the payment provider\n   * The provider informs Yuno about the claim\n   * Yuno logs the chargeback, and its initial transaction state is `CREATED`\n2. **Merchant notification**\n\n   * Yuno notifies the merchant about the chargeback and updates the payment's status\n3. **Merchant actions**\n\n   * The merchant can:\n     + **Submit evidence**: Provide documentation supporting the validity of the transaction, turning the chargeback into an active dispute\n     + **Accept the chargeback**: Acknowledge the claim without disputing it and lose the funds (`LOST`)\n4. **Evidence review**\n\n   * If evidence is submitted, the issuing bank reviews the documentation and issues a final decision (`PENDING_REVIEW`)\n5. **Chargeback/dispute resolution**\n\n   * **Dispute Won** (`WON`): The customer's claim is rejected, and the transaction remains valid\n   * **Dispute Lost** (`LOST`): The customer's claim is accepted, resulting in a refund to the customer\n\n## Chargeback States\n\nThe states of chargebacks in Yuno represent the various stages of the process:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/5affb7a6f6868047baf67fda23adbe8f44f4dd142a81c64dd6c2f0a5b6e857bf-Chargebacks_2.png)\n\n| **State** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- |\n| `CREATED` | A chargeback has been received; the merchant can take action or submit evidence if the provider supports it. |\n| `PENDING_REVIEW` | Evidence has been submitted and is under review by the issuing bank. |\n| `WON` | The dispute was resolved in favor of the merchant. |\n| `LOST` | The claim was accepted, resulting in a refund to the customer. |\n\n  \n\n| **Payment Status** | **Payment Substatus** | **Transaction Type** | **Transaction Status** | **Description** |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `SUCCEEDED` | APPROVED | Chargeback | Won | Chargeback dispute won |\n| `IN_DISPUTE` | RECEIVED | Chargeback | Created | Chargeback or Inquiry received. Decision or documentation must be provided in order to initiate a dispute. |\n|  | PENDING\\_REVIEW | Chargeback | Pending\\_review | Dispute in review by the provider |\n| `CHARGEBACK` | LOST | Chargeback | Lost | Expired/Closed/Review\\_lost |\n\n## Predisputes (deflections)\n\nSome networks and providers offer early-resolution programs that can deflect disputes before a formal chargeback is opened. Examples include Visa Rapid Dispute Resolution (RDR), Mastercard’s Ethoca ecosystem, and American Express Accelerated Dispute Resolution (ADR).\n\nWhen a provider/network explicitly reports a predispute deflection, Yuno:\n\n* Creates a `CHARGEBACK` transaction with `status = PREVENTED` so you can audit that a chargeback was prevented\n* Sets the payment to `status = CHARGEBACK` and `sub_status = LOST` to reflect the financial outcome\n* Emits only the chargeback webhook for the `CHARGEBACK / PREVENTED` transaction (no separate refund webhook)\n* Enforces idempotency to avoid duplicate transactions and notifications\n\nAdditional details:\n\n* No evidence required: predispute deflections do not require evidence submission\n* Dispute ID mapping: the Dispute ID equals the chargeback transaction ID\n* Optional fields: chargeback webhooks may include `provider_dispute_id` and `is_pre_dispute` to indicate predispute-origin cases\n\n`PREVENTED` is used only on transactions of type `CHARGEBACK` and is a terminal state for that transaction.\n\n### Example predispute\n\nJSON\n\n```\n{\n  \"transaction\": {\n    \"id\": \"tx_cb_001\",\n    \"type\": \"CHARGEBACK\",\n    \"status\": \"PREVENTED\",\n    \"category\": \"CARD\",\n    \"amount\": 19700,\n    \"provider_id\": \"STRIPE\",\n    \"provider_dispute_id\": \"du_1S2umUCXdfp1jQhWSW3lALH2\"\n  },\n  \"payment\": {\n    \"id\": \"pay_123\",\n    \"status\": \"CHARGEBACK\",\n    \"sub_status\": \"LOST\",\n    \"amount\": { \"currency\": \"USD\", \"value\": 19700, \"refunded\": 0, \"captured\": 19700 }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Key benefits of managing chargebacks with Yuno\n\nYuno simplifies and optimizes your chargeback management through several key advantages:\n\n### All your disputes in one integrated workflow\n\nConsolidate chargeback data from all your payment providers into one dashboard. Whether it's Visa, Mastercard, or a local acquirer, you can track, respond, and manage disputes centrally—no API stitching required.\n\n### Streamlined chargeback response\n\nAutomate chargeback responses with the right supporting documentation to ensure every dispute is addressed quickly and efficiently.\n\n### Ensure compliance\n\nEvery chargeback, every response, every update—logged and accessible. With built-in audit trails and exportable records, compliance and internal reviews are faster and easier.\n\n## Understand the reason code\n\nUnderstanding the reason code behind each chargeback is crucial, as it explains why the customer initiated the dispute. Familiarity with these codes allows you to tailor your response more effectively and gather the necessary information for each case. In the [Chargeback Reason Codes section](/docs/reason-codes), you can find a comprehensive list of all possible codes provided by acquirers. In each chargeback transaction you'll be able to find the reason code in the `response_code` field.\n\n## Evidence Management\n\nTo dispute a chargeback, the merchant must submit evidence supporting their case. In the context of dispute resolution services, evidence refers to any information or documentation that substantiates your position in a disagreement or claim. Providing compelling evidence is crucial for achieving a favorable outcome. Examples of such evidence include:\n\n* *Proof of delivery*: Documents confirming that a product was shipped and received by the customer, such as tracking numbers or delivery confirmations\n* *Customer communications*: Records of emails, text messages, or any exchanges that demonstrate agreements or clarifications made with the customer\n* *Refund and return policies*: Copies of the policies that the customer agreed to at the time of purchase, outlining the conditions for returns or refunds\n* *Proof of authenticity*: Documentation verifying the legitimacy of a transaction, like signed receipts or authentication records\n\nIt's essential that the evidence presented is clear, relevant, and directly pertains to the issue at hand. Additionally, organizing and presenting the evidence professionally and concisely will aid in its assessment by the parties involved in resolving the dispute.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Evidence requirements\n>\n> The uploaded files must meet the following criteria:\n>\n> * *Format*: File must be in PDF format, encoded as base64\n> * *Size*: File must be no larger than 1 MB in size\n> * *Language*: Dispute should be written in English or the country's local language\n\n### Example Request to Submit Evidence\n\nJSON\n\n```\nPOST https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/payments/:payment_id/transactions/:transaction_id/dispute\n\nHeaders:\n  X-Idempotency-Key: <unique-key>\n  X-Public-Api-Key: <api-key>\n  X-Private-Secret-Key: <secret-key>\n\nBody:\n{\n  \"account_id\":\"<Your Yuno account_id>\",\n  \"evidence\": [\n    {\n      \"file_name\": \"signed_receipt.pdf\",\n      \"content_type\": \"application/pdf\",\n      \"content_category\": \"RECEIPT\",\n      \"content\": \"JVBERi0xLjMKJcTl8uXrp/Og0MT...\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nPlease refer to the [Disputes API](/reference/disputes) reference section for more information.\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Payouts](/docs/payouts)[Chargeback Response Codes](/docs/reason-codes)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [What is a Chargeback?](#what-is-a-chargeback)\n  + [Chargeback Workflow](#chargeback-workflow)\n  + [Chargeback States](#chargeback-states)\n  + [Predisputes (deflections)](#predisputes-deflections)\n  + - [Example predispute](#example-predispute)\n  + [Key benefits of managing chargebacks with Yuno](#key-benefits-of-managing-chargebacks-with-yuno)\n  + - [All your disputes in one integrated workflow](#all-your-disputes-in-one-integrated-workflow)\n    - [Streamlined chargeback response](#streamlined-chargeback-response)\n    - [Ensure compliance](#ensure-compliance)\n  + [Understand the reason code](#understand-the-reason-code)\n  + [Evidence Management](#evidence-management)\n  + - [Example Request to Submit Evidence](#example-request-to-submit-evidence)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/e0034ded51f79400bd4698b840ec6c77237938e13ea3db078ae959c94d05f375-Chargebacks_disputes.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/e0034ded51f79400bd4698b840ec6c77237938e13ea3db078ae959c94d05f375-Chargebacks_disputes.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a flow diagram with the different types of the process"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/5affb7a6f6868047baf67fda23adbe8f44f4dd142a81c64dd6c2f0a5b6e857bf-Chargebacks_2.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/5affb7a6f6868047baf67fda23adbe8f44f4dd142a81c64dd6c2f0a5b6e857bf-Chargebacks_2.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a diagram showing the different types of the user"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

Merchant Server: Receive payment result --> Yuno Server: Provides payment result\n\n## Enroll a credit card while paying\n\nWith the Full SDK, you can save credit/debit cards for future purchases with the same payment request without the enrollment [integration](enrollment-lite). You can obtain the [vaulted token](/docs/tokens) in two ways:\n\n* **Via API**: Set `vault_on_success = true` when using the [Create payment](/reference/create-payment) endpoint. You will receive the `vaulted_token` that corresponds to the card used by the customer payer in the response.\n* **Via SDK settings**: Set `cardSaveEnable = true` in the SDK complementary features ([Web](/docs/complementary-features-full-sdk), [iOS](/docs/full-checkout-ios), and [Android](/docs/full-checkout-android). The SDK will display a checkbox for users to select if they want to save the card for future purchases. If the user checks the box, you will receive the `vaulted_token`.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Card Enrollment Options\n>\n> You should only use one option to enroll a card. To enroll alternative payment methods, you have to use the [Lite SDK](enrollment-lite).\n\nAfter enrolling a payment method, you can use the vaulted token to perform payments. To access information about the payment methods enrolled by each user, use one of the following endpoints:\n\n* [Get payment methods by checkout session](/reference/retrieve-payment-methods-for-checkout).\n* [Get payment methods by customer](/reference/retrieve-enrolled-payment-methods-api).\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Using a vaulted token\n>\n> Even if the user selects an enrolled payment method, Yuno recommends using the SDK to tokenize the information instead of directly using the vaulted token with Yuno's API. This approach provides several benefits:\n>\n> * **Support 3DS**: Enhanced security for online payments.\n> * **Fraud Screening**: Better protection against fraudulent transactions.\n> * **Collect Required Information**: Gather additional fields required by the provider if necessary.\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Seamless SDK](/docs/seamless-sdk)[Lite SDK (Payment)](/docs/the-ultimate-checkout-lite)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + - [Key features](#key-features)\n    - [What you can do with the full SDK](#what-you-can-do-with-the-full-sdk)\n  + [Payment workflow](#payment-workflow)\n  + - [Full SDK Integration Flow](#full-sdk-integration-flow)\n  + [Platform-specific SDK setup](#platform-specific-sdk-setup)\n  + [Payment workflow using a vaulted token](#payment-workflow-using-a-vaulted-token)\n  + - [Vaulted Token Full Diagram](#vaulted-token-full-diagram)\n  + [Enroll a credit card while paying](#enroll-a-credit-card-while-paying)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/0b97d1a-Diagrama_-_Full_SDK.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/0b97d1a-Diagrama_-_Full_SDK.png", "alt_text": "Full SDK Integration Flow", "caption_blip": "a diagram showing the flow of the system"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/e257d04-Diagrama_-_Vaulted_token_Full.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/e257d04-Diagrama_-_Vaulted_token_Full.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a diagram showing the flow of the flow flow flow"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}
{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/3d-secure", "title": "3D Secure", "content_markdown": "# 3D Secure\n\n## What is 3D Secure?\n\n3D Secure, or 3DS, is a security protocol for online payments designed to prevent the fraudulent use of credit cards in card-not-present (CNP) transactions. The protocol, developed in 1999, requires additional verification steps for customers during the purchase process to authenticate themselves and reduce the risk of fraud. The flow below presents a payment process using 3DS:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/0f08d565c96df5bed7bfa98cf4223662afc41323e477be6dd2c47163bbbb15d2-3ds1.png)\n\nWhere:\n\n* **Merchant Plugin Interface (MPI)** initiates the verification process by facilitating the secure exchange of information between the merchant, scheme Directory Server, and the cardholder’s issuing bank.\n* **Scheme Directory Server (DS)** acts as a centralized database and facilitates the identification of the appropriate cardholder’s issuing bank and the corresponding authentication method to be used.\n* **Issuer Access Control Server (ACS)** is responsible for verifying and validating the cardholder’s identity during a 3DS transaction. The Issuer ACS receives authentication requests and performs risk assessments and authentication checks based on the bank’s predefined rules and policies.\n\n3D Secure 2, or 3DS2, published in 2016, is an updated version of the original 3DS protocol and uses dynamic authentication methods such as biometrics and token-based authentication, whereas the original 3DS protocol relies on static passwords. 3DS2 aims to provide a better user experience with a more fluid flow for end users during authentication. EMVCo, an organization owned by major card brands, developed and managed both protocols. All major card brands stopped supporting the first version of 3DS in October 2022. Therefore, integrating the 3DS2 verification step is essential to ensure your customers' experience and security. Yuno already provides an easy 3DS2 integration for your business.\n\n![Visa logo](https://icons.prod.y.uno/visa_logosimbolo.png)\n\nVisa\n\n![Mastercard logo](https://icons.prod.y.uno/mastercard_logosimbolo.png)\n\nMastercard\n\n![American Express logo](https://icons.prod.y.uno/amex_logosimbolo.png)\n\nAmerican Express\n\n![JCB logo](https://icons.prod.y.uno/jcb_logosimbolo.png)\n\nJCB\n\n![Diners Club logo](https://icons.prod.y.uno/dinnersclub_logosimbolo.png)\n\nDiners Club\n\n![UnionPay logo](https://icons.prod.y.uno/unionpay_logosimbolo.png)\n\nUnionPay\n\n![Cartes Bancaires logo](https://icons.prod.y.uno/cartabancaire_logosimbolo.png)\n\nCartes Bancaires\n\n## Benefits of 3D Secure 2\n\nAs mentioned, 3DS2 was developed to enhance the user experience and adapt the 3DS protocol to the modern payment landscape.\n\n### Prepared for new technologies\n\n3DS2 was designed with the rise of smartphones in mind and allowed banks to offer innovative authentication experiences through their mobile banking apps, such as biometric authentication using fingerprints or facial recognition. Therefore, merchants can offer several authentication methods that align with consumer preferences and technological advancements, resulting in a more convenient and secure authentication process.\n\n### Integration capabilities\n\nRegarding integration, 3DS2 includes an SDK component that enables native integration into mobile apps. As a result, merchants can authenticate transactions within their own apps. Now, the challenge flow happens directly within the mobile checkout flows, eliminating the need for full-page redirects and providing a more seamless user experience.\n\n### Amount of data available for authentication\n\n3DS2 allows businesses to exchange ten times more data on each transaction to the cardholder's bank. This includes payment-specific data, such as shipping address, and contextual data, such as the customer's device ID or previous transaction history. This allows the bank to assess the transaction's risk level and potentially authenticate the payment without additional input from the cardholder. Therefore, a payment using 3DS2 protocols can face a **frictionless flow** or a **challenge flow** to complete the payment.\n\n#### Frictionless flow\n\nIn a frictionless flow, the customer's data is confirmed without any manual data entry. It happens when the system recognizes and verifies the customer’s device, and the data is exchanged in the background. As the customer is identified and validated with this information, no additional requests from the payment systems are necessary.\n\n#### Challenge flow\n\nThe challenge flow happens when the stored information isn't enough to validate the customer. As the customer's identity is not confirmed, the system requires an additional step to validate the customer, using a one-time password or biometric verification. Depending on the validation system, the customer may be redirected to a card issuer’s page to enter the necessary information.\n\nThe use of 3DS2 results in a smoother and more frictionless user experience. The improved data flows and decision-making capabilities enabled by 3DS2 reduce the cart abandonment rate and improve the conversion rates.\n\n## 3D Secure 2 Payment\n\nAdding the 3DS2 verification step to the checkout process changes the normal workflow. Below is a flow chart of the complete checkout and a description of each step to help you better understand the process.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/f2afaa011ad29c0b939a307042f50d9a4e11a1e31b51786e122f2b8992b6d2e5-3ds2.png)\n\n1. The customer provides their card data to initiate the merchant checkout process.\n2. The merchant's system checks if it supports 3DS2.\n3. If the merchant does not support 3DS2, the checkout process proceeds with the regular payment workflow without using the 3DS2 verification.\n4. If the merchant supports 3DS2, Yuno sends the transaction information to the issuer's 3DS service provider to assess the transaction risk. This data includes cardholder and device information upon regional or market law restrictions, such as device ID, MAC address, geo-location, previous transactions, and more.\n5. The issuer's 3DS service provider determines if the transaction is high-risk and if a challenge is necessary for additional verification.\n6. The payment proceeds to the authorization step if no challenge is necessary (frictionless flow).\n7. If a challenge is required (challenge flow), it is presented to the cardholder to verify their identity. This verification can use biometrics and/or two-factor authentication, such as a one-time password or a fingerprint.\n8. The system checks if the cardholder successfully completed the challenge.\n9. The payment proceeds to the authorization step if the cardholder successfully verifies their identity.\n10. If the cardholder fails to verify their identity, the payment is cancelled.\n11. The merchant checks with the card issuer if the transaction is authorized.\n12. If the transaction is authorized, the payment is processed successfully.\n13. If the transaction is not authorized, the payment is cancelled or declined.\n\n## Configuring 3D Secure for your payments\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### SDK v1.1 Enhancement\n>\n> With SDK v1.1, 3DS logic is handled automatically using the `continuePayment()` method - no separate 3DS setup is required. For more information, see the [Yuno Web SDK documentation](/docs/seamless-sdk-payment-web).\n\nYou decide if your system will implement the 3DS2 or not. The 3DS2 verification step is added while defining your cards [dynamic routing](/docs/routing#configuring-the-dynamic-routing). When starting your card routes, you can add the 3DS2 step before defining the payment provider. When adding the 3DS2 verification step, when a payment using a card is initialized, the Yuno system will analyze if the card needs an extra challenge. If an extra challenge is necessary, the user will be redirected to the bank environment to complete the authorization. On the other hand, the payment process will proceed normally.\n\nTo create payments with the 3DS DIRECT workflow, you need to fulfill some requirements.\n\n### Requirements\n\nBefore using 3DS DIRECT, you need to enable 3DS in your [Yuno Dashboard](https://dashboard.y.uno/) and specify the scenarios in which you want your customers to be able to use it. This can be configured in the Yuno Dashboard under: **Routing > Card Routes > 3DS Step**. These scenarios must be indicated on your CARD route. Additionally, you will require the following 3DS setup data in the payment provider connection:\n\n* **Acquirer BIN**: This is the Bank Identification Number (BIN) used to clear and settle the transaction, along with the country in which it is licensed for use.\n* **Merchant ID**: This is the affiliation number provided by the acquirer.\n* **Merchant Category Code (MCC)**: The acquirer will provide a specific code representing your merchant category.\n* **Merchant's Name**: Refers to the official name or business name of the company or entity conducting the commercial transaction.\n* **Merchant URL**: The merchant's website or online platform.\n* **Country Code**: The country where the payment needs to be processed, following the [ISO 3166-1](/reference/country-reference) Standard Country Codes.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Using an External MPI for Authentication\n>\n> If you are using an external MPI to perform the authentication, the following parameters are required for a successful connection with the provider:\n>\n> * Acquirer BIN\n> * Acquirer country code\n> * Merchant ID\n> * MCC\n\n## Yuno 3D Secure 2 integration\n\nThere are different ways of integrating 3DS in Yuno, depending on your needs.\n\nIn general terms, a 3DS integration requires a `setup_id`/`device_fingerprint` for the payment session as the first step for security analysis, and that id can only be obtained by executing a SDK/JS powered by a 3DS authorized provider. While using our SDKs **we take care of all the logic for you**, so you don't have to worry about different provider needs.\n\nTherefore, depending on your Yuno integration, you have three different options:\n\n1. **Checkout integration**: The Checkout workflow is part of the [Checkout](/docs/build-your-integration#checkout) solution provided by Yuno. Use our SDKs so we can handle all the logic regarding external provider requirements and executions for 3DS. If you want to define specific cases for 3DS analysis, you can define that in the CARD route of your Yuno dashboard.\n2. **External integration**: Use your own 3DS and then send the corresponding authorization fields in the [payment creation](/reference/create-payment) (card\\_data - eci, cryptogram, etc). Only available for PCI-compliant merchants.\n3. **Direct integration**: The Direct workflow is only available for PCI-compliant merchants. It provides a straightforward way to create a payment and validate user information, requiring the merchant to perform just one request to create the payment. To successfully implement the Direct integration, follow the steps outlined in the [integration guideline](/docs/direct-flow) and provide the required information as instructed. For each payment you'll have a:\n   1. `PENDING/WAITING_ADDITIONAL_STEP` status/sub status.\n   2. `sdk_action_required` set as `true`.\n   3. `redirect_url` defined in `payment.payment_method.payment_method_detail.card`.\n\nYou are responsible for redirecting your customers to the URL provided by the `redirect_url` so we can gather device information and present the challenge to the customer if necessary. Once the customer successfully completes the 3DS challenge, they will be automatically redirected to the `callback_url`, which you provided when creating the payment with the Create Payment endpoint.\n\nFor every scenario the Yuno [webhooks](/docs/configure-webhooks) will promptly notify you about the outcome of the 3DS challenge and the final payment status. This ensures that you receive real-time updates on the progress and completion of the payment transaction. Also, you can always get the payment information by using our [get payment service](/reference/retrieve-payment-by-id).\n\nAfter executing the 3DS for each scenario, you'll receive all the necessary information in the payment's response inside the `payment_method.detail.card.card_data.three_d_secure` object:\n\n| Field | Description | Example |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| version | Refers to the protocol version of the EMV 3-D Secure specification used. 1.0, 2.0, 2.1.0, 2.2.0, 2.2.1. | 2.2.1 |\n| electronic\\_commerce\\_indicator | This field must be completed with the result of the ECI field provided by the 3d Secure service. The Electronic Commerce Indicator (ECI) informs the card issuer if the transaction was protected by a security protocol like VbV or MCSC.

In Visa transactions, it represents the Cardholder Authentication Verification Value (CAVV), a cryptographic value generated by the Issuer as evidence of payment authentication during online purchase to qualify for chargeback protection. MasterCard transactions have a similar value called Accountholder Authentication Value (AAV) or the Universal Cardholder Authentication Field (UCAF). When submitting a transaction for authorization, the merchant must include the CAVV or AAV/UCAF to demonstrate that the cardholder has been authenticated. It is typically base64-encoded (MAX: 40, MIN: 0). | BA0BB1Z3N5Q4kjkBU3c3ELGUsJY = |\n| transaction\\_id | For 3DS v1: This is the Unique Transaction Identifier.

It progresses through different states that represent the authorization process. Once the 3DS transaction is marked as SUCCEEDED, Yuno proceeds to the processor and generates a PURCHASE transaction to charge the client. The following table describes all possible states and their descriptions.\n\n| Status | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| CREATED | Payment is created and waiting for Yuno's SDK session id. |\n| PENDING | The challenge is required, and the `redirect_url` is returned by Yuno. |\n| IN\\_PROCESS | The user is completing the challenge. |\n| SUCCEEDED | The challenge was completed correctly. |\n| DECLINED | The challenge was completed but declined by the bank. |\n| ERROR | An error occurred while redirecting to the user's challenge. |\n\nAs mentioned before, if the payment is PENDING/WAITING\\_ADDITIONAL\\_STEP, the 3DS transaction will be PENDING when a Challenge is required. After the challenge is completed, either successfully or not, the payment and transaction will be updated to the corresponding states (SUCCEEDED or DECLINED).\n\n### Using 3DS for Specific Scenarios\n\nWhen configuring the CARD route in the Yuno dashboard, you can specify for which situations 3DS should be executed using the [available conditions](/docs/routing#configuring-the-dynamic-routing). As mentioned previously, some preliminary steps will be necessary to execute 3DS depending on the integration method used.\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Remote Yuno MCP Server](/docs/remote-yuno-mcp-server)[Card Fingerprint](/docs/fingerprint)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [What is 3D Secure?](#what-is-3d-secure)\n  + [Benefits of 3D Secure 2](#benefits-of-3d-secure-2)\n  + - [Prepared for new technologies](#prepared-for-new-technologies)\n    - [Integration capabilities](#integration-capabilities)\n    - [Amount of data available for authentication](#amount-of-data-available-for-authentication)\n  + [3D Secure 2 Payment](#3d-secure-2-payment)\n  + [Configuring 3D Secure for your payments](#configuring-3d-secure-for-your-payments)\n  + - [Requirements](#requirements)\n  + [Yuno 3D Secure 2 integration](#yuno-3d-secure-2-integration)\n  + - [Transactions status](#transactions-status)\n    - [Using 3DS for Specific Scenarios](#using-3ds-for-specific-scenarios)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/0f08d565c96df5bed7bfa98cf4223662afc41323e477be6dd2c47163bbbb15d2-3ds1.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/0f08d565c96df5bed7bfa98cf4223662afc41323e477be6dd2c47163bbbb15d2-3ds1.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a diagram showing the different types of the cloud"}, {"original_url": "https://icons.prod.y.uno/visa_logosimbolo.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/visa_logosimbolo.png", "alt_text": "Visa logo", "caption_blip": "visa credit card"}, {"original_url": "https://icons.prod.y.uno/mastercard_logosimbolo.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/mastercard_logosimbolo.png", "alt_text": "Mastercard logo", "caption_blip": "a credit card with a red and yellow circle"}, {"original_url": "https://icons.prod.y.uno/amex_logosimbolo.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/amex_logosimbolo.png", "alt_text": "American Express logo", "caption_blip": "american express express express"}, {"original_url": "https://icons.prod.y.uno/jcb_logosimbolo.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/jcb_logosimbolo.png", "alt_text": "JCB logo", "caption_blip": "the jcb logo"}, {"original_url": "https://icons.prod.y.uno/dinnersclub_logosimbolo.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/dinnersclub_logosimbolo.png", "alt_text": "Diners Club logo", "caption_blip": "the logo for the new app"}, {"original_url": "https://icons.prod.y.uno/unionpay_logosimbolo.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/unionpay_logosimbolo.png", "alt_text": "UnionPay logo", "caption_blip": "the logo for union bank"}, {"original_url": "https://icons.prod.y.uno/cartabancaire_logosimbolo.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/cartabancaire_logosimbolo.png", "alt_text": "Cartes Bancaires logo", "caption_blip": "the logo for the company"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/f2afaa011ad29c0b939a307042f50d9a4e11a1e31b51786e122f2b8992b6d2e5-3ds2.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/f2afaa011ad29c0b939a307042f50d9a4e11a1e31b51786e122f2b8992b6d2e5-3ds2.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a flow diagram with the words, ' start ' and ' start '"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

They are widely used to load or top up user accounts, digital wallets, perform internal fund transfers within a payment platform.\n\nAFTs are a core component of payment orchestration systems, enabling efficient and secure movement of money across accounts.\n\n## What is an AFT?\n\nAn **AFT (Account Funding Transaction)** is a type of transaction designed for:\n\n* **Loading funds** into user accounts or digital wallets.\n* **Transferring funds** between accounts within the same platform.\n* **Depositing money** into commercial or personal accounts. Remittances included.\n\nAFTs leverage traditional payment networks (e.g., Visa, Mastercard, ACH) to process transactions quickly and securely while optimizing costs.\n\n### Types of AFT Transactions\n\n1. **Funding transactions**:\n\n   * Transfer funds into an account from a debit/credit card or bank account.\n   * Example: A user loads their digital wallet using their debit card.\n2. **Withdrawal transactions**:\n\n   * Move funds from a user account back to their bank account or card.\n   * Example: A user transfers money from their digital wallet to their bank account.\n\n## Integration\n\nTo perform an AFT, you will need to send a request to our [Payments API](/reference/create-payment) with the `additional_data.order.account_funding` object specifying the `sender` and`beneficiary` data.\n\nEach credit card scheme might require different information about the recipient and the sender, depending on the operating region and transaction category.\n\nExample\n\n```\n[...]\n \"additional_data\": {\n   \"order\": {\n    \"account_funding\": {\n      \"sender\": {\n        \"first_name\": \"John\",\n        \"last_name\": \"Doe\",\n        \"email\": \"[email protected]\"\n      },\n      \"beneficiary\": {\n        \"first_name\": \"Chris\",\n        \"last_name\": \"Martin\",\n        \"document\": {\n          \"document_number\": \"38192019\",\n          \"document_type\": \"CC\"\n        }\n      }\n     }\n    }\n  }\n[...]\n```\n\nFor more details, refer to the create [payments API](/reference/create-payment) section.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Additional Data\n>\n> In case you need to define additional information about the seller, such as `merchant_category_code`for example, you can find extra fields in the seller\\_details inside the [additional\\_data struct](/reference/the-payment-object) in the payment.\n\nUpdated 6 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Split Payments Marketplace](/docs/split-payments-marketplace)[Payment Details](/docs/payment-amount-details)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Introduction](#introduction)\n  + [What is an AFT?](#what-is-an-aft)\n  + - [Types of AFT Transactions](#types-of-aft-transactions)\n  + [Integration](#integration)", "images": [], "source": "Yuno Docs"}
{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/create-payment-basic", "title": "Create Payments", "content_markdown": "# Create Payments\n\nOn this page, you will find a walk-through guide on creating a payment and the necessary information to accomplish such a task.\n\n## Requirements\n\nBefore starting following the steps described in this guide, you need to:\n\n* Access your [API credentials](/docs/developers-credentials) on the Yuno Dashboard, which are composed by:\n  + `public-api-key`\n  + `private-secrete-key`\n  + `account_id`\n* [Set up your connections](/docs/connections) on your Yuno Dashboard account.\n* [Build a route](/docs/routing) for the payment method to define how it will be processed.\n* [Configure the checkout builder](/docs/checkout-builder) to make your connected payments available.\n\nMake sure to complete these requirements before following the create payment guide.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Explore Yuno Postman Collections\n>\n> Yuno provides [Postman Collections](/reference/postman-collections) that you can use to replicate the use cases locally.\n\n## Steps summary\n\nThe create payment process normally requires finishing the four steps listed below.\n\n1. [Create a customer](/reference/create-customer)\n2. [Create a checkout session](/reference/create-checkout-session)\n3. [Create a one-time token](#step-3-create-a-one-time-token-ott)\n4. [Create the payment](/reference/create-payment)\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Additional payment methods and functionalities\n>\n> Different payment methods, such as with specific wallets or BNPL, or functionalities, such as split payments, may require additional steps before creating the payment.\n\n## Create a payment\n\n### Step 1: Create a customer\n\nUse the [Create Customer](/reference/create-customer) to register the customer info. You will need to provide personal customer information. In addition, you also need to supply the `merchant_customer_id`, a unique identifier for the customer used on your system.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Customer complementary information\n>\n> When creating a **Customer**, certain information is not required but can improve the user's payment experience if provided. Phone, billing address, and shipping address are examples of not mandatory data you can provide.\n>\n> If you add optional information, be aware of the required mandatory fields.\n\nAt the end of the create a customer process, you will receive an `id`, which identifies the user within the Yuno system. Use the `id` to initialize the checkout.\n\nIf you are creating a payment for an existing user who was previously created and already had an `id` you can skip this step.\n\n### Step 2: Create a checkout session\n\nWith a customer registered, you can create a checkout session. The checkout is when the customer finalizes their order and proceeds to pay for the products or services they wish to acquire. Therefore, at this stage, you will provide information regarding the payment amount and the location where it is being created.\n\nUse the [Create Checkout Session](/reference/create-checkout-session) endpoint. Notice that the `customer_id` required to perform the request is the `id` you received when creating the customer in [Step 1](/docs/create-payment-basic#1-create-a-customer).\n\nFrom the request response to the [Create Checkout Session](/reference/create-checkout-session) endpoint, you will receive the `checkout_session` information. It will be used to create the one-time token (OTT) and the payment on the next steps.\n\n### Step 3: Create a one-time token (OTT)\n\nAn one-time token is a unique identifier Yuno generates to protect your customer privacy and security. It serves as an identifier for payments detail and prevents sensitive data from being stored on your servers. Therefore, you can use one-time tokens to make it simple for your customers to repeat payments without re-entering their payment information, making the process more secure and convenient.\n\nYou will always get the one-time token from the Yuno SDK on your application. By using Yuno's SDK we take care of every particular scenario that different payment methods could have. This allows us to:\n\n* Ask for missing information for the enrolled payment method in case the selected provider in the CARD route needs some additional fields.\n* Support fraud screening\n* Support 3DS\n\nYou can always use the list [Payment type](/reference/payment-type-list) to check all available payment types. In the response of the SDK, you will receive the `one-time-token`, which you will use to create the payment.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Testing credit card payments\n>\n> Remember that for testing credit card payments you can set the [Yuno Test Payment Gateway](/docs/yuno-testing-gateway) as a provider in your Card route.\n\n### Step 4: Create a payment\n\nYou will create a payment using the endpoint [Create Payment](/reference/create-payment). With Yuno, you can create payments with several payment methods, using 3DS or split payments. However, this guide focuses on a simple payment without additional authentication, validation, or enrollment requirements.\n\nBelow, you find a deeper description of how to create a payment.\n\n#### 4.1 Provide the required attributes\n\nProvide customer-related information, including the `checkout_session` from Step 2 through `checkout.session` and `customer_payer` object that contains the `id` from Step 1.\n\nCertain objects are not mandatory when creating a payment. However, if you provide this information, the user’s payment experience will be enhanced. Be aware of the mandatory fields if you wish to provide this information.\n\n#### 4.2 Choose the capture type\n\nYuno provides two options for payment capture:\n\n* Single-step: Authorization and capture are performed simultaneously. You only need to create the payment. The authorization and capture are performed automatically. For the single-step option, you need to send the attribute `capture` as `true` on the request.\n* Two steps: Authorization and capture are performed at different moments. After creating the payment, you will need to perform an authorization request and a capture request. If you wish to process the payment in Two Steps, send `capture` as `false` and after creating the payment, use the [Authorize Payment](/reference/authorize-payment) and the [Capture Authorization](/reference/capture-authorization) to complete the process.\n\n#### 4.3 Additional features\n\nYuno also lets you use some additional features that are supported in the basic payment creation process:\n\n* `vault_on_success`: If your customer uses a credit card to make the payment, we let you enroll that payment method for the customer for future purchases in the same step.\n* `installments`: In case you offer your clients installments for their payments and your chosen processor accepts them, you can send us the amount of installments to create the payment with.\n\nBoth fields can be found in the payment\\_method detail section of the payment.\n\n> ℹ️\n>\n> To generate and receive a `vaulted_token` when `vault_on_success = true`, the payment must reference an existing Yuno customer through `customer_payer.id`. Creating or sending the customer data inline inside the payment request does not create the customer on our side, so no vaulting will occur.\n\n### Step 5: Check the payment status\n\nAfter performing the request to the [Create Payment](/reference/create-payment) endpoint, you can check the payment status by analyzing the `status` and `sub_status` from the response. Check the page [Payment Status](/reference/payment) to see all options you can receive in response to the payment creation request.\n\nDepending on the processor and payment method, the status may take some time to update. Therefore, you may need to use endpoints to recover the payment status. To perform this task, you can use the [Retrieve Payment by ID](/reference/retrieve-payment-by-id) or [Retrieve Payment by merchant\\_order\\_id](/reference/retrieve-payment-by-merchant-order-id). Another option is to use webhooks to receive notifications after each event. Yuno recommends you use webhooks to monitor asynchronous payments better. Check the [Webhooks](/docs/configure-webhooks) guide to learn how to configure the webhooks solution provided by Yuno.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Test Card Payments\n>\n> If you need to test Card payments in general, Yuno provides the Yuno Test Payment Gateway. It works as a connection, however, it is available only in the sandbox environment. Check the [Yuno Test Payment Gateway page](yuno-testing-gateway) to learn all functionalities, or go directly to the guide on [how to test card payments](yuno-testing-gateway#test-card-payments-with-yuno-testing-gateway).\n\nUpdated 3 days ago\n\n---\n\nWhat’s Next\n\n* [Yuno Testing Gateway](/docs/yuno-testing-gateway)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Requirements](#requirements)\n  + [Steps summary](#steps-summary)\n  + [Create a payment](#create-a-payment)\n  + - [Step 1: Create a customer](#step-1-create-a-customer)\n    - [Step 2: Create a checkout session](#step-2-create-a-checkout-session)\n    - [Step 3: Create a one-time token (OTT)](#step-3-create-a-one-time-token-ott)\n    - [Step 4: Create a payment](#step-4-create-a-payment)\n    - [Step 5: Check the payment status](#step-5-check-the-payment-status)", "images": [], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

There are two types of sessions: **customer sessions** and **checkout sessions**. These sessions ensure the correct information is collected for each scenario.\n\n## Customer session\n\nUse customer sessions to enroll and store a customer's payment methods. Create a new customer session each time you register a payment method for a specific customer. You'll need the `customer_id` (a unique customer identifier) generated when creating the customer in Yuno. A customer session provides access to all available payment methods for enrollment, which you can offer to customers.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Available payment methods\n>\n> When creating both sessions, customer and checkout, the Yuno system will provide you with a list of all enable the payment methods in your Yuno dashboard within the Connections and Checkout builder section.\n\nFor more detailed information on how to use the Create customer session endpoint, see [API reference](/reference/the-customer-session-object).\n\n## Checkout session\n\nUse checkout sessions to create payments or initiate the payment flow. Each time a customer makes a payment, you must create a new session. You'll need the `customer_id` (a unique customer identifier) generated when creating the customer in Yuno. A checkout session provides access to all available payment methods for that customer, whether previously enrolled or not.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Create a payment without a checkout session\n>\n> By utilizing Direct integration, which doesn't require Yuno's SDK, you can create a payment without the need for a checkout session.\n\nFor more detailed information on how to use the **Create checkout session** endpoint, refer to the [API reference](/reference/the-checkout-session-object).\n\nUpdated 6 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Customers](/docs/customers)[Payments](/docs/payments-1)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Customer session](#customer-session)\n  + [Checkout session](#checkout-session)", "images": [], "source": "Yuno Docs"}
{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/the-ultimate-checkout-lite", "title": "Lite SDK (Payment)", "content_markdown": "# Lite SDK (Payment)\n\nThe **Lite SDK** provides full control over your payment experience. Unlike the [Full SDK](/docs/full-sdk-workflow), this version allows you to query available payment methods and decide which to display at checkout. After the customer selects a payment method, the payment process follows the same steps as the Full SDK.\n\nAdditionally, the Lite SDK supports enrolling payment methods for future use. For more details, see [Lite SDK (Enrollment)](/docs/enrollment-lite).\n\nWith the Lite SDK, you can:\n\n* Execute the payment process\n* Enroll a credit card while making a payment\n* Use a vaulted token from an enrolled payment method to complete a transaction\n\nUse the following guides to implement each process:\n\n[#### Payment workflow](#payment-workflow)[#### Payment workflow using a vaulted token](#payment-workflow-using-a-vaulted-token)[#### Enroll a credit card while paying](#enroll-a-credit-card-while-paying)\n\n## Payment workflow\n\nThe diagram below illustrates the complete payment workflow:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/4e2b909-Diagrama_-_SDK_Lite.png)\n\n### SDK Lite Payment Flow\n\nThis diagram illustrates the payment process using the SDK Lite, detailing the interactions between the Merchant Client, Merchant Server, Yuno Server, and Yuno SDK. It outlines the steps from initiating a checkout and selecting payment methods to creating and completing the payment.\n\n#### Components Overview\n\nThe payment workflow involves several key components working together to process payments securely. Here's how each component contributes to the process:\n\n#### Merchant Client\n\nThe Merchant Client represents your frontend application that handles the user interface and payment flow. Its key responsibilities include:\n\n* Initiate Checkout\n* List payment methods\n* User selects payment methods\n* Initiate SDK with checkout session and payment method\n* Gets token (single use)\n* Initiate payment\n* Initiate SDK to continue payment flow\n\n#### Merchant Server\n\nThe Merchant Server represents your backend application that coordinates between your frontend and Yuno's services. Its key responsibilities include:\n\n* Create Customer\n* Create Checkout session\n* Request available payment method\n* Create payment\n* Receive payment result via webhook\n\n#### Yuno Server\n\nThe Yuno Server handles all backend operations related to payment processing and provider integration. Its key responsibilities include:\n\n* Creates Customer\n* Creates Checkout session\n* Returns available payment method\n* Creates payment in the payment provider\n* Receive payment results from payment provider\n\n#### Yuno SDK\n\nThe Yuno SDK manages the payment flow on the client side, handling user interactions and payment processing. Its key responsibilities include:\n\n* Receives checkout session and payment method selected by user\n* Callback with the one-time token\n* Continue with the payment flow\n* Shows screen for the user to complete payment\n* Display payment result (optional)\n\n#### Complete Flow\n\nThe following steps outline the complete interaction flow between all components of the SDK Lite Payment integration, detailing how each request and response moves through the system:\n\n1. Merchant Server: Create Customer --> Yuno Server: Creates Customer\n2. Merchant Client: Initiate Checkout --> Merchant Server: Create Checkout session\n3. Merchant Server: Create Checkout session --> Yuno Server: Creates Checkout session\n4. Merchant Client: Initiate Checkout --> Merchant Client: List payment methods\n5. Merchant Client: List payment methods --> Merchant Client: User selects payment methods\n6. Merchant Client: User selects payment methods --> Merchant Client: Initiate SDK with checkout session and payment method\n7. Merchant Client: Initiate SDK with checkout session and payment method --> Yuno SDK: Receives checkout session and payment method selected by user\n8. Yuno SDK: Receives checkout session and payment method selected by user --> Yuno SDK: Callback with the one-time token\n9. Yuno SDK: Callback with the one-time token --> Merchant Client: Merchant Client: Gets token (single use)\n10. Merchant Client: Merchant Client: Gets token (single use) --> Merchant Client: Initiate payment\n11. Merchant Client: Initiate payment --> Merchant Client: Initiate SDK to continue payment flow\n12. Merchant Client: Initiate SDK to continue payment flow --> Yuno SDK: Continue with the payment flow\n13. Yuno SDK: Continue with the payment flow --> Yuno SDK: Shows screen for the user to complete payment\n14. Merchant Client: Initiate Checkout --> Merchant Server: Create Checkout session\n15. Merchant Client: List payment methods --> Merchant Server: Request available payment method\n16. Merchant Client: Initiate payment --> Merchant Server: Create payment\n17. Merchant Server: Create payment --> Yuno Server: Creates payment in the payment provider\n18. Merchant Server: Receive payment result via webhook --> Yuno Server: Receive payment results from payment provider\n19. Yuno Server: Receive payment results from payment provider --> Yuno SDK: Display payment result (optional)\n\n## Platform-specific SDK setup\n\nTo implement the Lite SDK integration, follow the platform-specific guides below:\n\n[#### Web](../docs/lite-checkout-sdk)[#### iOS](../docs/lite-checkout-ios)[#### Android](../docs/lite-checkout-android)\n\n## Payment workflow using a vaulted token\n\nIf your customer has enrolled in one of the available payment methods, the payment can be made back-to-back using the [Vaulted token](/docs/tokens) from the enrollment process. With this approach, you don't need to request additional information about the payment method.\n\nThe following image describes the complete workflow:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/45a2289-Diagrama_-_Vaulted_token_Lite.png)\n\n### Vaulted Token Lite Flow\n\nThis diagram illustrates the payment process using a vaulted token with the SDK Lite, detailing the interactions between the Merchant Client, Merchant Server, Yuno Server, and Yuno SDK. It outlines the steps from initiating a checkout and using a pre-stored payment method to creating and completing the payment.\n\n#### Components Overview\n\nThe vaulted token payment workflow involves several key components working together to process payments securely. Here's how each component contributes to the process:\n\n#### Merchant Client\n\nThe Merchant Client represents your frontend application that handles the user interface and payment flow. Its key responsibilities include:\n\n* Initiate Checkout\n* Render payment methods\n* Initiate payment\n* Shows payment results\n\n#### Merchant Server\n\nThe Merchant Server represents your backend application that coordinates between your frontend and Yuno's services. Its key responsibilities include:\n\n* Create Checkout session\n* Request available payment method\n* Create payment\n* Receive payment result\n\n#### Yuno Server\n\nThe Yuno Server handles all backend operations related to payment processing and provider integration. Its key responsibilities include:\n\n* Creates Checkout session\n* Returns enabled payment method\n* Creates payment in the payment provider\n* Provides payment results\n\n#### Complete Workflow\n\nThe following steps outline the detailed sequence of interactions between the different components in the vaulted token payment workflow:\n\n1. Merchant Client: Initiate Checkout --> Merchant Server: Create Checkout session\n2. Merchant Server: Create Checkout session --> Yuno Server: Creates Checkout session\n3. Merchant Client: Render payment methods --> Merchant Server: Request available payment method\n4. Merchant Server: Request available payment method --> Yuno Server: Returns enabled payment method\n5. Merchant Client: Render payment methods --> Merchant Client: Initiate payment\n6. Merchant Client: Initiate payment --> Merchant Server: Create payment\n7. Merchant Server: Create payment --> Yuno Server: Creates payment in the payment provider\n8. Merchant Client: Shows payment results --> Merchant Server: Receive payment result\n9. Merchant Server: Receive payment result --> Yuno Server: Provides payment results\n\nUnlike the [Payment workflow](#payment-workflow), for payments using the vaulted token, you'll use information from an existing customer who has previously enrolled in the payment method.\n\nThis workflow follows the same steps as the Payment workflow, but instead of collecting new payment details, the SDK retrieves the stored vaulted token. For detailed implementation steps, refer to the platform-specific guides above.\n\n## Enroll a credit card while paying\n\nWith the **Lite SDK**, you can save credit or debit cards for future purchases within the same payment request, **without** additional enrollment integration.\n\n### How to obtain a vaulted token\n\nYou can retrieve a vaulted token in two ways:\n\n* **Via API:** Set `vault_on_success = true` when using the [Create payment](/reference/create-payment) endpoint. The response will return the `vaulted_token` for the customer's card.\n* **Via SDK settings:** Enable `cardSaveEnable = true` in the SDK settings for [Web](/docs/lite-checkout-sdk), [iOS](/docs/lite-checkout-ios), or [Android](/docs/lite-checkout-android). The SDK will display a checkbox allowing users to save their card.\n\nUse only one method to enroll a card. To enroll alternative payment methods, see the [Lite SDK (Enrollment)](/docs/enrollment-lite) page.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Card Enrollment Options\n>\n> You should only use one option to enroll a card. To enroll alternative payment methods, see the [Lite SDK (Enrollment)](enrollment-lite) page.\n\nAfter enrolling in a payment method, you can use the vaulted token to perform payments. To access information about the payment methods enrolled by each user, use one of the following endpoints:\n\n* [Get payment methods by checkout session](/reference/retrieve-payment-methods-for-checkout).\n* [Get payment methods by customer](/reference/retrieve-enrolled-payment-methods-api).\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Best Practices for Using Vaulted Tokens\n>\n> Even if the user selects an enrolled payment method, Yuno recommends using the SDK to tokenize the information instead of directly using the vaulted token with Yuno's API. This approach provides several benefits:\n>\n> * **Support 3DS**: Enhanced security for online payments.\n> * **Fraud Screening**: Better protection against fraudulent transactions.\n> * **Collect Required Information**: Gather additional fields required by the provider if necessary.\n>\n> To implement this, send the `vaultedToken` when mounting the SDK. The SDK will handle the rest. If the payment method requires an extra step (such as a 3DS challenge), use the `yuno.continuePayment()` method. This method handles any required redirections and works for both enrolled and regular payment methods that need additional customer actions.\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Full SDK](/docs/full-sdk-workflow)[Lite SDK (Enrollment)](/docs/enrollment-lite)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Payment workflow](#payment-workflow)\n  + - [SDK Lite Payment Flow](#sdk-lite-payment-flow)\n  + [Platform-specific SDK setup](#platform-specific-sdk-setup)\n  + [Payment workflow using a vaulted token](#payment-workflow-using-a-vaulted-token)\n  + - [Vaulted Token Lite Flow](#vaulted-token-lite-flow)\n  + [Enroll a credit card while paying](#enroll-a-credit-card-while-paying)\n  + - [How to obtain a vaulted token](#how-to-obtain-a-vaulted-token)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/4e2b909-Diagrama_-_SDK_Lite.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/4e2b909-Diagrama_-_SDK_Lite.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a diagram showing the different types of the system"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/45a2289-Diagrama_-_Vaulted_token_Lite.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/45a2289-Diagrama_-_Vaulted_token_Lite.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a flow diagram with the flow flow diagram"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/yuno-testing-gateway", "title": "Yuno Testing Gateway", "content_markdown": "# Yuno Testing Gateway\n\nTo test Card payments in general, Yuno provides the **Yuno Test Payment Gateway**. It works as a connection, however, it is available **only** in the sandbox environment.\n\n## Connecting with Yuno\n\n**Mandatory fields when integrating via Yuno**:\n\nYuno Test Payment Gateway doesn't requiere any key.\n\n## General information\n\n**Countries**:\n\n![globe-flag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/writechoiceorg/yuno-images/main/flags/world.png)\n\nAvailable in for all countries.\n\n**Currencies**:\n\nAll currencies are available.\n\n**Type of cards**:\n\nCredit, Debit and Prepaid.\n\n**Test data**:\n\n[Card information](../docs/yuno-testing-gateway#44-provide-the-payment-method-information) to complete payments in test mode.\n\n## Integration configuration\n\n**Dashboard configuration**:\n\n1. Log in to [dashboard.y.uno](http://dashboard.y.uno/).\n2. Click **Connections** and then select **Yuno Test Payment Gateway**.\n3. Click **Connect**.\n4. Introduce **Name**.\n5. Click **Connect**\n\n## Production environment\n\n**Specific procedure for a merchant to go live**:\n\nThis connection is available only for testing procedures.\n\n## Set up the Yuno Test Payment Gateway\n\n1. Complete the Test Payment Gateway [Integration configuration](/docs/yuno-testing-gateway#integration-configuration).\n2. After establishing the connection, you must designate the Yuno Test Payment Gateway as your card payment provider in your routing section. Access [Routing](https://dashboard.y.uno/routing) on the Yuno Dashboard, select **Not published**, find the **Card** option, and click **Set Up**.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/c556c04-image.png)\n\n3. Create a new route for **Card**. If you are unsure how to create it, check the [Configure dynamic routing](/docs/routing#configuring-the-dynamic-routing).\n   1. On the Routing dashboard, add conditions to trigger the card payment. You can use card brand or country as trigger conditions, for example.\n   2. For the created condition, add the Yuno Test Payment Gateway.\n   3. For the **All other payments** options, select the **Cancel** option. The below image presents an example of a routing configuration where the card brand condition was used, accepting payments with Visa and Mastercard brands.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/75de840-image.png)\n\n4. Now you need to make the cards available for testing. Access [Checkout builder](https://dashboard.y.uno/checkout-builder) on the Yuno Dashboard. Activate the toggle button for **Card** and publish the checkout using the **Publish** button.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/4240aa0-image.png)\n\nUse the [Create payment](/docs/create-payment-basic) guide to learn how to test card payments.\n\n## Test card payments with Yuno Testing Gateway\n\nOn this page, you will find a walk-through guide on creating a card payment using the [Yuno Testing Gateway](/docs/yuno-testing-gateway).\n\n[Yuno Testing Gateway](/docs/yuno-testing-gateway) is a Yuno solution to test card payment in general. It works as a connection. However, it is only available in the sandbox environment.\n\n### Requirements\n\nBefore starting following the steps described in this guide, you need to:\n\n* Access your [API credentials](/docs/developers-credentials) on the Yuno Dashboard, which are composed by:\n  + `public-api-key`\n  + `private-secret-key`\n  + `account_id`\n* Set up the Yuno Testing Gateway connection on your Yuno Dashboard account. You find a step-by-step guide on connecting it in the [Integration configuration section](/docs/yuno-testing-gateway#integration-configuration).\n* [Build a route](/docs/routing#configuring-the-dynamic-routing) for the Yuno Testing Gateway to define it as your card payment provider. You find a step-by-step guide on how to do it in the Set up the [Yuno Testing Gateway section](/docs/yuno-testing-gateway#set-up-the-yuno-test-payment-gateway).\n* [Configure the checkout builder](/docs/checkout-builder) to make the Yuno Testing Gateway available.\n\n### Steps summary\n\nThe create payment process normally requires finishing the four steps listed below.\n\n1. [Create a customer](/reference/create-customer)\n2. [Create a checkout session](/reference/create-checkout-session)\n3. [Create a One-Time Token](#3-create-a-one-time-token-ott)\n4. [Create the payment](/reference/create-payment)\n\n### Create a payment\n\n#### 1. Create a customer\n\nUse the [Create Customer](/reference/create-customer) to register the customer info. You will need to provide personal customer information. In addition, you also need to supply the `merchant_customer_id`, a unique identifier for the customer used on your system.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Customer Complementary Information\n>\n> When creating a **Customer**, certain information is not required but can improve the user's payment experience if provided. Phone, billing address, and shipping address are examples of non-mandatory data you can provide. If you add optional information, be aware of the required mandatory fields.\n\nAt the end of the create a customer process, you will receive an `id`, which identifies the user within the Yuno system. Use the `id` to initialize the checkout.\n\nIf you are creating a payment for an existing user who was previously created and already has an `id`you can skip this step.\n\n#### 2. Create a checkout session\n\nWith a customer registered, you can create a checkout session. The checkout is when the customer finalizes their order and proceeds to pay for the products or services they wish to acquire. Therefore, at this stage, you will provide information regarding the payment amount and the location where it is being created.\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Route Conditions Filtering\n>\n> When creating the route, you can define conditions that work as filters. If you have used country as a condition, check if the provided country when creating the checkout session is on the condition list. Otherwise, the card payment may not be processed by the Yuno Testing Gateway.\n\nUse the [Create Checkout Session](/reference/create-checkout-session) endpoint. Notice that the `customer_id` required to perform the request is the `id` you received when creating the customer in [Step 1](/docs/yuno-testing-gateway#1-create-a-customer).\n\nFrom the request response to the [Create Checkout Session](/reference/create-checkout-session) endpoint, you will receive the `checkout_session` information. It will be used to create the one-time token (OTT) and the payment on the next steps.\n\n#### 3. Create a one-time token (OTT)\n\nAn OTT is a unique identifier Yuno generates to protect your customer privacy and security. It serves as an identifier for payments detail and prevents sensitive data from being stored on your servers. Therefore, you can use OTTs to make it simple for your customers to repeat payments without re-entering their payment information, making the process more secure and convenient.\n\nYou will always get the OTT from the Yuno SDK on your production application. However, to make it easier for you to test the payment creation process, Yuno provides the Create OTT endpoint. You will need to provide the `checkout_session` received in [Step 2](/docs/yuno-testing-gateway#2-create-a-checkout-session) and define the payment type as `CARD` through the `type` parameter. In the response, you will receive the `one-time-token`, which you will use to create the payment.\n\n#### 4. Create a payment\n\nYou will create a payment using the [Create Payment endpoint](/reference/create-payment). Below you find a deeper description of how to create a payment.\n\n#### 4.1 Provide the required attributes\n\nProvide customer-related information, including the `checkout_session` from Step 2 through `checkout.session` and `customer_payer` object that contains the `id` from Step 1.\n\nCertain objects are not mandatory when creating a payment. However, if you provide this information, the user’s payment experience will be enhanced. Be aware of the mandatory fields if you wish to provide this information.\n\n#### 4.2 Choose the capture type\n\nYuno provides two options for payment capture:\n\n* Single-step: Authorization and capture are performed simultaneously. You only need to create the payment. The authorization and capture are performed automatically. For the single-step option, you need to send the `capture` attribute as `true` on the request.\n* Two steps: Authorization and capture are performed at different moments. After creating the payment, you will need to perform an authorization request and a capture request. if you wish to process the payment in Two Steps, send `capture` as `false` and after creating the payment, use the [Authorize Payment](/reference/authorize-payment) and the [Capture Authorization](/reference/capture-authorization) to complete the process.\n\n#### 4.3 Define the payment workflow\n\nWhen creating the payment, you need to inform which integration from Yuno you are using. When creating a payment, you must inform it through the `workflow` attribute, which can be:\n\n* `CHECKOUT`: If you are using the Yuno SDK to create the payment.\n* `DIRECT`: If you are using a back-to-back integration. To use this workflow, you need to be PCI compliant.\n* `REDIRECT`: If you are using a back-to-back integration and provider redirection.\n\n#### 4.4 Provide the payment method information\n\nInform the payment method information through the object `payment_method`. Here, you will provide the `one-time-token` through the attribute `token` and select the payment `type` equal to `CARD`, the one informed in [Step 3](/docs/yuno-testing-gateway#3-create-a-one-time-token-ott), based on the [Payment type list](/reference/payment-type-list). In addition, you need to add the card information on the object `detail.card`.\n\nYou can use the payment description or specific card data to get the desired result when you test payment with Yuno Test Payment Gateway. The following sections describe in detail each approach.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Yuno System Process\n>\n> Yuno system follows a sequential process, initially examining card data and subsequently evaluating the provided description. Consequently, if there is a disparity in the status indicated by the card data and the description for a testing payment, Yuno will prioritize and reflect the status associated with the card data.\n\n##### 4.4.1 - Payment Description\n\nTo get the desired payment result using the payment description, you need to define the expected result as the description of the payment you create. For example, if you are testing a payment and expect a successful result, the payment description should be \"SUCCEEDED\". You will find all available options in the [Transaction Codes](/reference/transaction#transaction-codes) section.\n\n##### 4.4.2 - Card detail\n\nAnother option to get the expected payment results is to use one of the testing cards provided by Yuno. In the tables below, you find a list of cards and their data details to use when using the Yuno Testing Gateway. The **Transaction Response Code** column defines the returned payment status when you use the corresponding card.\n\nVisa\n\n| Number | Expiration Date | Security Code | Cardholder Name | Transaction Response Code |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 4507990000000002 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | SUCCEEDED |\n| 4507990000000010 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | INSUFFICIENT\\_FUNDS |\n| 4507990000000028 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | DECLINED\\_BY\\_BANK |\n| 4507990000000036 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | DO\\_NOT\\_HONOR |\n| 4507990000000044 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | INVALID\\_SECURITY\\_CODE |\n| 4507990000000051 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | INVALID\\_CARD\\_DATA |\n| 4507990000000069 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | REPORTED\\_STOLEN |\n| 4507990000000077 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | ERROR |\n\nMastercard\n\n| Number | Expiration Date | Security Code | Cardholder Name | Transaction Response Code |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 5252440000000002 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | SUCCEEDED |\n| 5252440000000010 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | INSUFFICIENT\\_FUNDS |\n| 5252440000000028 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | DECLINED\\_BY\\_BANK |\n| 5252440000000036 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | DO\\_NOT\\_HONOR |\n| 5252440000000044 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | INVALID\\_SECURITY\\_CODE |\n| 5252440000000051 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | INVALID\\_CARD\\_DATA |\n| 5252440000000069 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | REPORTED\\_STOLEN |\n| 5252440000000077 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | ERROR |\n\nAmerican Express\n\n| Number | Expiration Date | Security Code | Cardholder Name | Transaction Response Code |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 370000000000002 | 11/28 | 1234 | John Doe | SUCCEEDED |\n| 370000000000010 | 11/28 | 1234 | John Doe | INSUFFICIENT\\_FUNDS |\n| 370000000000028 | 11/28 | 1234 | John Doe | DECLINED\\_BY\\_BANK |\n| 370000000000036 | 11/28 | 1234 | John Doe | DO\\_NOT\\_HONOR |\n| 370000000000044 | 11/28 | 1234 | John Doe | INVALID\\_SECURITY\\_CODE |\n| 370000000000051 | 11/28 | 1234 | John Doe | INVALID\\_CARD\\_DATA |\n| 370000000000069 | 11/28 | 1234 | John Doe | REPORTED\\_STOLEN |\n| 370000000000077 | 11/28 | 1234 | John Doe | ERROR |\n\nDiners\n\n| Number | Expiration Date | Security Code | Cardholder Name | Transaction Response Code |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 3647166000000002 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | SUCCEEDED |\n| 3647166000000010 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | INSUFFICIENT\\_FUNDS |\n| 3647166000000028 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | DECLINED\\_BY\\_BANK |\n| 3647166000000036 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | DO\\_NOT\\_HONOR |\n| 3647166000000044 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | INVALID\\_SECURITY\\_CODE |\n| 3647166000000051 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | INVALID\\_CARD\\_DATA |\n| 3647166000000069 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | REPORTED\\_STOLEN |\n| 3647166000000077 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | ERROR |\n\nUATP\n\n| Number | Expiration Date | Security Code | Cardholder Name | Transaction Response Code |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1139000000000002 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | SUCCEEDED |\n| 1139000000000010 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | INSUFFICIENT\\_FUNDS |\n| 1139000000000028 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | DECLINED\\_BY\\_BANK |\n| 1139000000000036 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | DO\\_NOT\\_HONOR |\n| 1139000000000044 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | INVALID\\_SECURITY\\_CODE |\n| 1139000000000051 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | INVALID\\_CARD\\_DATA |\n| 1139000000000069 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | REPORTED\\_STOLEN |\n| 1139000000000077 | 11/28 | 123 | John Doe | ERROR |\n\n#### 4.4.3 - 3DS Test Cards\n\nUse these cards and OTP codes to test 3DS flows through our preview environment using a Netcetera Demo Merchant (NDM) Simulator, which is configured to mock a Directory Server and/or ACS with predefined schemes and testing card numbers.

Check the payment status\n\nAfter performing the request to the [Create Payment](/reference/create-payment), you can check the payment status by analyzing the `status` and `sub_status` from the response. Check the [Payment Status](/reference/payment) page to see all the options you can receive in response to the payment creation request.\n\nDepending on the processor and payment method, the status may take some time to update. Therefore, you may need to use endpoints to recover the payment status. To perform this task, you can use the [Retrieve Payment by ID](/reference/retrieve-payment-by-id) or [Retrieve Payment by merchant\\_order\\_id](/reference/retrieve-payment-by-merchant-order-id) endpoints. Another option is to use webhooks to receive notifications after each event. Yuno recommends you use webhooks to monitor asynchronous payments better. Check the [Webhooks](/docs/configure-webhooks) guide to learn how to configure the webhooks solution provided by Yuno.\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago\n\n---\n\n[3DS Configuration and Testing](/docs/3ds-configuration-and-testing)[Enrollment](/docs/enrollment)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Connecting with Yuno](#connecting-with-yuno)\n  + [General information](#general-information)\n  + [Integration configuration](#integration-configuration)\n  + [Production environment](#production-environment)\n  + [Set up the Yuno Test Payment Gateway](#set-up-the-yuno-test-payment-gateway)\n  + [Test card payments with Yuno Testing Gateway](#test-card-payments-with-yuno-testing-gateway)\n  + - [Requirements](#requirements)\n    - [Steps summary](#steps-summary)\n    - [Create a payment](#create-a-payment)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/writechoiceorg/yuno-images/main/flags/world.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/world.png", "alt_text": "globe-flag", "caption_blip": "a green earth with a white background"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/c556c04-image.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/c556c04-image.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the pay card is displayed on the screen"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/75de840-image.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/75de840-image.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a diagram showing the different types of the user"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/4240aa0-image.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/4240aa0-image.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the payment process, with the payment options highlighted"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

This functionality leverages **Google Pay's official OCR** (Optical Character Recognition) solution.\n\n## Security & privacy\n\nThe card data is processed directly by **Google Pay's OCR**. Neither Yuno nor Google retains or stores the scanned card details.\n\n## Card details detected\n\nThe OCR scanner detects the following card details via the device camera:\n\n* **Card Number**\n* **Expiration Date** (Month and Year)\n\n## Prerequisites for merchants\n\nTo enable and use the Card Scanning feature, your Android application must meet the following requirements:\n\n1. **SDK Version:** Your application must be using Yuno Android SDK version 2.8.0 or higher.\n2. **Camera Permissions:** Your application must request and obtain the necessary camera permissions from the user at runtime, in accordance with standard Android development practices.\n3. **Google Pay Availability:** The feature requires your application to have access to the Google Pay Services on the user's device.\n\n## How to activate\n\nTo enable the card scanning feature, you must activate it in the Checkout Builder from your Yuno Dashboard:\n\n1.

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/teams-and-roles", "title": "Teams and Roles", "content_markdown": "# Teams and Roles\n\nThe **Team and roles** section allows you to create teams, define roles, and assign permissions with precision. This setup supports structured collaboration and enforces access controls to maintain a secure and organized environment. To access this section within the Yuno dashboard, click your profile image and select **Team and roles**.\n\n## Harnessing the power of teams\n\n* **Building dynamic teams**: Yuno allows you to create flexible teams composed of users from different accounts. A single user can be part of multiple teams, each with unique roles tailored to their responsibilities.\n* **Cross-account participation**: Yuno supports cross-account collaboration, enabling users to contribute to teams across different accounts. This promotes a unified, efficient workflow across your organization.\n* **Customizable roles**: Roles define each member's level of access and responsibilities. Yuno offers a set of predefined roles with specific permissions, ensuring that every user has the appropriate tools and access to perform their tasks.\n\n## Working with teams\n\nThe **Team members** tab allows you to invite new members and manage existing ones. The actions available to you will depend on your assigned permissions.\n\n* **Invite members**: Send one or more invitations via email and assign roles to new members.\n* **Member management**: Click the three-dot icon next to a member's name to edit their role or delete them from the team.\n\nUse **Add filters** to sort between your [accounts](../docs/account-management).\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Team for each account\n>\n> Please, take into consideration that you will have to create a team for each account you have created.\n\n[](https://github.com/writechoiceorg/yuno-images/raw/main/doc/yourPaymentsOperationSystem/team_and_rols-v2.mp4)\n\n## The dynamics of roles\n\nDefining clear roles and permissions strengthens the security of your operations. Each team member works within a specific scope, reducing the risk of accidental errors or unauthorized access. Roles give individuals the access they need to do their jobs efficiently, while keeping workflows organized and secure.\n\nThere are two types of roles in Yuno:\n\n* **Default roles**: Yuno offers a set of predefined roles, each encapsulating a distinct array of permissions. These default roles serve as a foundation for streamlined team functioning.\n* **Custom role creation**: Yuno's flexibility extends to crafting custom roles. Tailor permissions to suit your precise requirements, allowing your teams to function optimally while adhering to the principle of least privilege.\n\nThere are 6 types of default roles:\n\n| Roles | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Admin | An Admin user has access to all features in the dashboard. |\n| Agent | An Agent user can view and take actions on payments. |\n| Developer | A Developer user can view and take actions on integrations and webhooks. |\n| Read only | A Read-only user can view all features in the dashboard. |\n| Custodian | Assign this role when you invite Yuno team experts to join your team. |\n| IAM Admin | Users with this role manage access and security settings like SSO, MFA, and roles. |\n\nThe **Roles management** tab shows the permissions assigned to each role. Select **Create role** to define custom roles tailored to your team's specific needs.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/9d84cbf80d0179fe25cf559b896b93061e2e3b99c4c71778f8e39421a8f3d509-teams_and_roles.png)\n\n## Creating custom roles\n\nTo create a custom role, navigate to the **Roles management** tab and select **Create role**. You can then define the role name, description, and assign specific permissions for each environment according to your team's needs.\n\nYuno's **Create role** feature provides enhanced flexibility for role management by allowing you to create custom roles with environment-specific permissions. This feature enables you to define precise access controls for different environments, promoting better security and operational control.\n\n### Environment-specific configuration\n\nFor each permission, you can independently configure access for:\n\n* **Sandbox environment**: Perfect for testing and development activities\n* **Production environment**: For live operations and sensitive data\n\nThis granular control allows you to create roles where users might have full access in sandbox for testing purposes, but restricted access in production for security reasons.\n\n### Available permissions\n\nThe custom role creation interface includes these permissions:\n\n* **Insights** - Access to actionable payment insights\n* **Payments** - View and operate payments, manage payment links\n* **Payouts** - View payouts and transaction details\n* **Reconciliation** - View settlement reports\n* **Connections** - View and manage payment connections\n* **Routing** - View and manage processing routes\n* **Checkout builder** - View and build checkout configurations\n* **Developers** - View and manage account keys\n* **Webhooks** - View and manage webhooks\n* **Accounts** - Manage account settings\n* **Team and roles** - View and manage team members and roles\n* **Risk conditions** - View and manage rules and lists\n* **Audit logs** - View dashboard, API, and monitor logs\n* **Security** - Manage 2FA and SSO configurations\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Account Management](/docs/account-management)[Single Sign-On (SSO)](/docs/single-sign-on-sso)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Harnessing the power of teams](#harnessing-the-power-of-teams)\n  + [Working with teams](#working-with-teams)\n  + [The dynamics of roles](#the-dynamics-of-roles)\n  + [Creating custom roles](#creating-custom-roles)\n  + - [Environment-specific configuration](#environment-specific-configuration)\n    - [Available permissions](#available-permissions)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/9d84cbf80d0179fe25cf559b896b93061e2e3b99c4c71778f8e39421a8f3d509-teams_and_roles.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/9d84cbf80d0179fe25cf559b896b93061e2e3b99c4c71778f8e39421a8f3d509-teams_and_roles.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the team dashboard on a tablet"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

Contact your Yuno representative if you need historical details about the integration.\n\nThe Yuno ClearSale SDK provides device fingerprinting and fraud prevention capabilities by integrating with ClearSale and is designed to complement the Yuno Payments SDK.\n\n## Installation (Swift Package Manager - SPM)\n\n`YunoAntifraudClearsale` is installed exclusively via Swift Package Manager (SPM).\n\n### 1. Swift Package Manager (SPM)\n\nThis is the recommended method for versions 1.3.0 and later.\n\nIn Xcode, go to `File > Add Packages...`\n\nEnter the ClearSale repository URL:\n\n`https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-antifraud-clearsale-ios`\n\nEnsure you select version `1.3.0` or higher.\n\n### 2. CocoaPods\n\nYou can also use CocoaPods for version `1.3.0`. Add the following line to your `Podfile`:\n\nRuby\n\n```\npod 'YunoAntifraudClearsaleSDK', '~> 1.3.0'\n```\n\n## Core SDK Dependency\n\nThis package also requires you to add the main Yuno SDK as a dependency. Repeat the SPM installation process with the following URL:\n\nGitHub - yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-ios\n\n## Usage\n\nThe minimum required version is iOS 14.0.\n\n### Fraud Provider Configuration\n\nTo integrate `YunoAntifraudClearsale`, you must configure it as a fraud provider within the `YunoSDK` before calling any payment initiation method (`startPaymentLite` or `startPayment`).\n\nMake sure to import both modules and then use the static method `Yuno.setFraudProviders(with:)`:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nimport YunoSDK\nimport YunoAntifraudClearsale // Import the provider class\n\n// Configure Clearsale as a fraud provider.\n// You must pass an instance of the class inside an array.\nYuno.setFraudProviders(with: [YunoAntifraudClearsale()])\n\n// Once the provider is configured, you can initiate the payment process.\n// Yuno.startPaymentLite(...) or Yuno.startPayment(...)\n```\n\nUpdated 12 days ago\n\n---\n\n[Headless SDK (Payment iOS)](/docs/headless-sdk-payment-ios)[Secure Fields](/docs/web-secure-fields)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Installation (Swift Package Manager - SPM)](#installation-swift-package-manager---spm)\n  + - [1.

The flux below presents a payment process using 3DS:\n\n![3DS Payment Process](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/writechoiceorg/yuno-images/main/doc/concepts/concepts-3ds.png)\n\n## Key components of 3DS\n\n* **Merchant Plugin Interface (MPI)**: Initiates the verification process and securely exchanges information between the merchant, scheme directory server, and issuing bank.\n* **Scheme Directory Server (DS)**: Acts as a centralized database that identifies the issuing bank and determines the authentication method.\n* **Issuer Access Control Server (ACS)**: Verifies the cardholder's identity during a 3DS transaction. The ACS evaluates authentication requests and performs risk assessments based on the bank's policies.\n\n## 3D Secure 2 (3DS2)\n\nReleased in 2016, 3D Secure 2 (3DS2) enhances security while improving the user experience. Unlike the original 3DS, which relied on static passwords, 3DS2 introduces biometric authentication and token-based verification for a smoother, more secure process.\n\n### Key improvements of 3DS2\n\n* Supports authentication via biometrics, one-time passwords, and risk-based authentication.\n* Reduces transaction friction with a seamless flow for trusted customers.\n* Enhances fraud detection through detailed data sharing between merchants and banks.\n\nEMVCo, an organization owned by major card networks, develops and manages 3DS2. As of October 2022, all major card brands have discontinued support for the original 3DS, making 3DS2 integration essential for secure transactions.\n\nYuno provides an easy 3DS2 integration, ensuring secure and frictionless payments for your customers.\n\n## Benefits of 3D Secure 2\n\n3DS2 enhances security while improving the user experience, adapting the original protocol to modern payment technologies.\n\n### Optimized for new technologies\n\nDesigned for the rise of smartphones, 3DS2 enables banks to offer biometric authentication, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, through mobile banking apps. This flexibility allows merchants to provide authentication methods that align with user preferences, creating a more convenient and secure checkout experience.\n\n### Integration capabilities\n\n3DS2 includes an SDK component that enables native mobile app integration, allowing merchants to authenticate transactions directly within their apps. This eliminates full-page redirects, ensuring a smooth and uninterrupted checkout process.\n\n### Enhanced data for authentication\n\n3DS2 enables businesses to share ten times more transaction data with the cardholder's bank. This includes payment-specific details (e.g., shipping address) and contextual data (e.g., device ID, transaction history). With more data, banks can assess risk more accurately and often authenticate payments without additional input from the customer.\n\n### Authentication flows in 3DS2\n\n#### Frictionless flow\n\nIn a frictionless flow, the system verifies the customer's identity automatically, using background data exchange. Since the system already recognizes the user's device and information, no additional action is needed.\n\n#### Challenge flow\n\nIf the available data isn't enough to verify the customer, the system triggers a challenge flow. This requires an additional authentication step, such as a one-time password or biometric verification. The customer may also be redirected to their card issuer's page for further validation.\n\n### Better user experience and conversion rates\n\nBy reducing friction in the authentication process, 3DS2 improves the checkout experience, lowers cart abandonment rates, and increases conversion rates, making online payments both more secure and user-friendly.\n\nUpdated 4 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Fraud prevention](/docs/fraud)[Overview](/docs/overview)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [What is 3D Secure](#what-is-3d-secure)\n  + [Key components of 3DS](#key-components-of-3ds)\n  + [3D Secure 2 (3DS2)](#3d-secure-2-3ds2)\n  + - [Key improvements of 3DS2](#key-improvements-of-3ds2)\n  + [Benefits of 3D Secure 2](#benefits-of-3d-secure-2)\n  + - [Optimized for new technologies](#optimized-for-new-technologies)\n    - [Integration capabilities](#integration-capabilities)\n    - [Enhanced data for authentication](#enhanced-data-for-authentication)\n    - [Authentication flows in 3DS2](#authentication-flows-in-3ds2)\n    - [Better user experience and conversion rates](#better-user-experience-and-conversion-rates)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/writechoiceorg/yuno-images/main/doc/concepts/concepts-3ds.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/concepts-3ds.png", "alt_text": "3DS Payment Process", "caption_blip": "a diagram showing the different types of the cloud"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}
{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/headless-sdk-enrollment-android", "title": "Headless SDK (Enrollment Android)", "content_markdown": "# Headless SDK (Enrollment Android)\n\nThis page provides a guide to the Yuno Headless SDK for Android enrollment.\n\nThe Yuno Headless SDK for Android provides a flexible, UI-free solution for enrolling payment methods and tokenizing cards.\n\nThis SDK offers complete control over the payment method enrollment process, making it ideal for merchants who:\n\n* Need full control over the UI and user experience\n* Want to implement custom enrollment flows\n* Require advanced integration capabilities\n\nThe Headless SDK includes core features like:\n\n* Card tokenization\n* Secure payment method enrollment\n* Direct API access\n* Custom error handling\n\nFor merchants requiring a pre-built UI solution or simpler integration, consider using our other SDK implementations:\n\n* [Full SDK](/docs/full-checkout-android)\n* [Lite SDK](/docs/enrollment-android)\n\n## Requirements\n\nBefore starting the Yuno Android SDK integration, ensure your project meets the [technical requirements](/docs/requirements-android). Also, ensure the following prerequisites are in place:\n\n* You must have an active Yuno account\n* You need your Yuno API credentials:\n  + `account_id`\n  + `public-api-key`\n  + `private-secret-key`\n\nYou can obtain these credentials from the [Developers section of the Yuno dashboard](../docs/developers-credentials). They are required to:\n\n* Create a `customer`, which is required before enrolling payment methods\n* Create a `customer_session`, which initializes the enrollment flow\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### SDK Version Information\n>\n> Verify the current SDK version by accessing the [Release notes](release-notes-android-sdk) or visiting the [Yuno Android SDK repository](https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-android).\n\n## Step 1: Create a customer\n\nCreate a customer using the [Create Customer](/reference/create-customer) endpoint before enrolling payment methods.\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n\n* Active Yuno account\n* API credentials\n\n**Required for:**\n\n* Identifying the person enrolling the payment method\n* Enabling saved payment method functionality\n* Tracking enrollment history\n* Store the customer ID securely for the next step.\n\n## Step 2: Create a customer session\n\nCreate a new `customer_session` using the [Create Customer Session](/reference/create-customer-session) endpoint:\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n\n* Customer ID from Step 1\n* API credentials\n\n**Required actions:**\n\n* Include the customer ID in the request\n* Store the returned `customer_session` ID\n* Generate a new `customer_session` for each payment method enrollment.\n\n## Step 3: Add the SDK to your project\n\n**Prerequisites:**\n\n* Android project setup\n* Gradle configuration access\n\n1. Add the repository source:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nmaven { url \"https://yunopayments.jfrog.io/artifactory/snapshots-libs-release\" }\n```\n\n2. Add the SDK dependency:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'com.yuno.payments:android-sdk:{last_version}'\n}\n```\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Internet Permission Required\n>\n> The Yuno SDK automatically includes the `INTERNET` permission, necessary for network requests. Ensure your AndroidManifest.xml contains:\n>\n> `<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" />`\n\n## Step 4: Initialize Headless SDK with the public key\n\nRetrieve your public API keys from the [Yuno dashboard](https://dashboard.y.uno/).\n\nIf you haven't implemented a custom application, create one. In the `onCreate()` method of your application class, call the initialize function (`Yuno.initialize`):\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nclass CustomApplication : Application() {\n  override fun onCreate() {\n    super.onCreate()\n    Yuno.initialize(\n      this,\n      PUBLIC_API_KEY,\n      config: YunoConfig,\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Step 5: Create a customer session\n\nTo start the enrollment process:\n\n1. Create a customer using the [Create Customer](/reference/create-customer) endpoint. The response will include the customer `id`.\n2. Create a customer session using:\n\n   * The customer `id` from step 1\n   * The [Create Customer Session](/reference/create-customer-session) endpoint\n\nThe endpoint response will provide the `customer_session` value required for enrollment.\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Customer Session Generation\n>\n> You need to generate a new `customer_session` each time you enroll a payment method.\n\n## Step 6: Create an enrollment payment method object\n\nCreate an enrollment payment method object using the [Enroll Payment Method](/reference/enroll-payment-method-checkout) endpoint to set up the Headless SDK integration for enrollment. When creating this object, specify which payment method type your customer can enroll in. Currently, the Headless SDK only supports the CARD payment method type.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Card Verification\n>\n> To verify cards (zero value authorization) before enrollment, include the `verify` object when creating the payment method object for the customer session. [Learn more](#verify-cards)\n\n## Step 7: Start the enrollment process\n\nUse the `apiClientEnroll` function to start the enrollment process. This function requires configuration parameters that define how the enrollment will be processed. The following table describes the required parameters:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `country_code` | This parameter determines the country for which the payment process is being configured. The complete list of supported countries and their `country_code` is available on the [Country coverage](/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk) page. |\n| `customer_session` | Refers to the current enrollment's [customer session](/docs/sessions) received as a response to the [Create Customer Session](/reference/create-customer-session) endpoint. Example: `438413b7-4921-41e4-b8f3-28a5a0141638` |\n\nThe following code block shows an example of the parameter configuration:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\noverride fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\n\tval apiClientEnroll = Yuno.apiClientEnroll(\n  \tcountry_code = \"CO\",\n    \n    customerSession = \"eec6578e-ac2f-40a0-8065-25b5957f6dd3\",\n\n    context = this \n  )\n }\n```\n\n## Step 8: Generate a vaulted token\n\nAfter collecting all required customer information, create a `vaulted_token` using the `apiClientEnroll.continueEnrollment` function. Since this is an asynchronous function, use a `try/catch` block to handle any errors that may occur. The following example shows how to create a `vaulted_token`:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\napiClientEnroll.continueEnrollment( \n collectedData = EnrollmentCollectedData(\n    customerSession = \"customer_session\",\n    paymentMethod = EnrollmentMethod(\n           type = \"CARD\",\n           card = CardData(\n               save = true,\n               detail = Detail(\n                   expirationMonth = 11,\n                   expirationYear = 55,\n                   number = \"4111111111111111\",\n                   securityCode = \"123\",\n                   holderName = \"Firstname Lastname\",\n                   type = CardType.DEBIT\n               ),\n           customer = Customer(\n               id = \"id\",\n               merchantCustomerId = \"merchant_customer_id\",\n               firstName = \"firstName\",\n               email = \"[email protected]\",\n               country = \"CO\",\n               document = Document(\n                   documentType = \"PAS\",\n                   documentNumber = \"PAS12312\"\n               ),\n             phone = Phone(\n                   number = \"321123321123\",\n                   country_code = \"57\"\n               )\n            )\n      )\n   ),\n  context = this\n )\n```\n\nThe `apiClientEnroll.continueEnrollment` function returns an Observable type that extends `LiveData`. You can observe the response as a standard `LiveData` with type `SingleLiveEvent<Map<String, Any?>>`. This `LiveData` emits only once and returns a `Map` containing the complete response. Below is an example response from calling `apiClientEnroll.continueEnrollment`:\n\nJSONText\n\n```\n{\n  \"vaulted_token\": \"9104911d-5df9-429e-8488-ad41abea1a4b\",\n  \"status\": \"SUCCEEDED\",\n  \"customer\": {\n    \"session\": \"eec6578e-ac2f-40a0-8065-25b5957f6dd3\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe following code block shows an example of observing the response:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\napiClientPayment.continueEnrollment(data, context).observe(context) { response ->\n   val status = response[\"status\"] as String?\n   val vauldtedtoken = response[\"vaulted_token\"] as String?\n}\n```\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Webhook Status Tracking\n>\n> Consider using the enrollment status received via [Webhooks](#webhooks). Yuno recommends always using this status to base and make business decisions on your platform.\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Lite SDK (Enrollment Android)](/docs/enrollment-android)[Headless SDK (Payment Android)](/docs/headless-sdk-payment-android)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Requirements](#requirements)\n  + [Step 1: Create a customer](#step-1-create-a-customer)\n  + [Step 2: Create a customer session](#step-2-create-a-customer-session)\n  + [Step 3: Add the SDK to your project](#step-3-add-the-sdk-to-your-project)\n  + [Step 4: Initialize Headless SDK with the public key](#step-4-initialize-headless-sdk-with-the-public-key)\n  + [Step 5: Create a customer session](#step-5-create-a-customer-session)\n  + [Step 6: Create an enrollment payment method object](#step-6-create-an-enrollment-payment-method-object)\n  + [Step 7: Start the enrollment process](#step-7-start-the-enrollment-process)\n  + [Step 8: Generate a vaulted token](#step-8-generate-a-vaulted-token)", "images": [], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/direct-flow", "title": "Direct Flow Integration", "content_markdown": "# Direct Flow Integration\n\n## How it works\n\nIf you are a developer, you can use our Direct Flow to continue using your checkout and connect to our services using only a server-to-server connection.\n\nYour company must be PCI-certified to use our server-to-server card payments service. Please forward your AOC certification to your account manager before beginning the implementation.\n\n> ❗️\n>\n> We always recommend using Yuno's SDKs over Direct Flow integrations. Yuno's SDKs are PCI compliant and simplify the payment process by managing all complexities, including fraud prevention, 3DS, and payment provider-specific requirements. Direct Flow requires merchants to handle these aspects manually, increasing complexity and risk.\n\nFor every implementation, we recommend taking the payment `status` and `sub_status` as the main reference for the [payment's state](/reference/payment). A payment could have different [transactions](/reference/transaction) associated with it, so by focusing on the payment **status/sub\\_status**, you can have the latest state regardless of how many transactions were made, giving you clear input for decision-making. With this integration, you can also [enroll credit cards](/docs/direct-flow#enrollment) for future purchases (also only available for PCI-compliant merchants).\n\n## Payment\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/d13bfc9-Diagrama_-_Direct_flow_pago.png)\n\n### Step 1: Create a customer\n\n**[Optional]**: The first step of the payment flow is to create a customer. A customer will have payment methods associated. You can create a customer using the following [endpoint](/reference/create-customer). As a result, you will receive the customer's ID that was created in the Yuno DB.\n\nYou can skip this step if you have previously created the customer.\n\nThis step is optional because you can send the customer information directly in the payment without creating a customer object in Yuno.\n\n### Step 2: Create the payment\n\nAs you handle the whole payment experience with this integration, you will need to display the payment methods enabled in your Yuno account. Once the user has selected the payment method, you can create a payment. A payment gathers all crucial details regarding the order, customer specifics, total amount, currency, products, shipping details, and more. You can create a Payment using the following [endpoint](/reference/create-payment).\n\nYou can use the [examples section](/reference/payment-examples) in the API reference as a reference. If the user selects a previously enrolled payment method, you can use the `vaulted_token` returned by the `get payment methods` service to create the payment.\n\nDuring the integration, we recommend taking the payment **status** and **sub\\_status** as the main reference for the payment's state. A payment could have different transactions associated with it, so by focusing on the payment **status/sub\\_status**, you can have the latest state regardless of how many transactions were made, giving you clear input for decision-making.\n\n### DIRECT vs REDIRECT Workflow\n\nWhile using the Direct integration in Yuno, for Alternative Payment Methods (PSE, Nequi, MercadoPago, PIX, etc.), you have two available `workflow` options:\n\n* **DIRECT**: We return the raw response from the providers so you can build the experience however you like with the unfiltered data.\n* **REDIRECT**: While we also return the direct response from the providers, we also offer merchants the possibility to use a redirection link provided by Yuno where we handle the payment experience just for that payment. You can find such a URL in the `payment_method.detail.redirect_url` field in the payment's response.\n\n### Important Add-ons\n\n* **Webhooks**: We recommend configuring [Webhooks](/docs/webhooks) in your Yuno dashboard. Webhooks are the best way to ensure your system stays up-to-date with payment progress and status. Since event notifications are triggered automatically, your system won't need to perform repeated requests to Yuno.\n* **Device Fingerprints**: The customer's device fingerprints are used for fraud prevention purposes. They are usually generated by using third-party JavaScript in the checkout. If you are using a **Direct integration** and want to support fraud providers in the [payment flow](/reference/create-payment), you can use this object to specify the necessary information. For integrations using Yuno checkout, the value is obtained automatically, so do not send this field.\n\n  + JSON\n\n    ```\n    [...]\n    \"customer_payer\": {\n        \"merchant_customer_id\": \"1690161049\",\n        \"first_name\": \"Giovanna\",\n        \"last_name\": \"Bartell\",\n        \"email\": \"[email protected]\",\n         \"device_fingerprints\": [\n            {\n                \"provider_id\": \"MERCADO_PAGO\",\n                \"id\": \"20a6c463-dd0c-4323-9115-03668d178856\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"provider_id\": \"CLEARSALE\",\n                \"id\": \"92d2ea4b-4bf7-494b-aaea-c48276135941\"\n            }     \n      }, \n    [...]\n    ```\n* **three\\_d\\_secure\\_setup\\_id**: Use our JS only to get the `three_d_secure_setup_id` and then handle the payment as an only API integration. The Direct workflow is only available for PCI-compliant merchants. It provides a straightforward way to create a payment and validate user information, requiring the merchant to perform just one request to create the payment. To successfully implement the Direct integration, follow the steps outlined in the [integration guideline](/docs/direct-flow) and provide the required information as instructed. This service is not necessary for 3DS implementation using Yuno's SDK.\n\n## Enrollment\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/26b6ffc-Diagrama_-_Direct_flow_registro.png)\n\n### Step 1: Create a customer\n\nThe first step of the payment flow is to create a customer.

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/sdk-customizations-ios", "title": "SDK Customizations", "content_markdown": "# SDK Customizations\n\nThis page explains how to modify styles in the Yuno iOS SDK by changing font, button, and color styles. To customize the iOS SDK appearance, set the appearance fields. This solution allows you to adapt the visual elements of the SDK to match your application brand, improving consistency and the UX.\n\n## Appearance configuration\n\nThe following table lists all available fields you can use to customize the iOS SDK:\n\n| Field | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `fontFamily` | Specifies the font family used in the SDK. Provide the font file name used in your app, ensuring it matches your application's assets. |\n| `accentColor` | Defines the accent color used in several SDK elements. |\n| `buttonBackgroundColor` | Sets the background color for the primary buttons. |\n| `buttonTitleColor` | Determines the text color for the primary buttons. |\n| `buttonBorderColor` | Specifies the border color for the primary buttons. |\n| `secondaryButtonBackgroundColor` | Sets the background color for the secondary buttons. |\n| `secondaryButtonTitleColor` | Determines the text color for the secondary buttons. |\n| `secondaryButtonBorderColor` | Specifies the border color for the secondary buttons. |\n| `disableButtonBackgroundColor` | Sets the background color for the disabled-buttons. |\n| `disableButtonTitleColor` | Determines the text color for the disabled-buttons. |\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Color Configuration\n>\n> Ensure all colors are specified as UIColor to maintain compatibility. Colors can be sourced from Xcode's predefined palette or the merchant's assets, but they must always be of type UIColor.\n\nUse the `Yuno.Appearance()` function to define a variable with all your customizations to control the appearance. Then inform it when initializing the SDK:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nlet appearance = Yuno.Appearance(\n    fontFamily: \"Climate Crisis\",\n    accentColor: UIColor.orange, \n    buttonBackgroundColor: UIColor.yellow, \n    buttonTitleColor: UIColor.black, \n    buttonBorderColor: UIColor.black,\n    secondaryButtonBackgroundColor: UIColor.yellow,\n    secondaryButtonTitleColor: UIColor.black,\n    secondaryButtonBorderColor: UIColor.black,\n    disableButtonBackgroundColor: UIColor.gray,\n    disableButtonTitleColor: UIColor.black\n)\n\nYuno.initialize(\n    apiKey: apiKey,\n    config: YunoConfig(appearance: appearance)\n)\n```\n\n### Usage examples\n\nThe following examples show two appearance customizations for the iOS SDK:\n\nExample 1 (left)Example 2 (right)\n\n```\nlet appearance = Yuno.Appearance(\n    fontFamily: \"Climate Crisis\",\n    accentColor: UIColor.black, \n    buttonBackgroundColor: UIColor.black, \n    buttonTitleColor: UIColor.white\n)\n\nYuno.initialize(\n    apiKey: apiKey,\n    config: YunoConfig(appearance: appearance)\n)\n```\n\n```\nlet appearance = Yuno.Appearance(\n    fontFamily: \"Climate Crisis\",\n    accentColor: UIColor.orange, \n    buttonBackgroundColor: UIColor.orange, \n    buttonTitleColor: UIColor.white\n)\n\nYuno.initialize(\n    apiKey: apiKey,\n    config: YunoConfig(appearance: appearance)\n)\n```\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/47e26ec-image.png)\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Secure Fields (Enrollment)](/docs/secure-fields-enrollment)[Complementary features](/docs/complementary-features-full-sdk)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Appearance configuration](#appearance-configuration)\n  + - [Usage examples](#usage-examples)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/47e26ec-image.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/47e26ec-image.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the log log screen with the log button highlighted"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}
{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/clearsale-sdk-android", "title": "ClearSale SDK (Android)", "content_markdown": "# ClearSale SDK (Android)\n\nThe Yuno ClearSale SDK provides device fingerprinting and fraud prevention capabilities by integrating with ClearSale. This SDK is distributed separately as `com.yuno.fraud-prevention:clearsale` and is designed to complement the Yuno Payments SDK.\n\nBy collecting device information and generating a `sessionId`, the ClearSale SDK helps enhance fraud prevention during the payment flow.\n\n## Requirements\n\nBefore starting the integration:\n\n* Ensure you have an active ClearSale account and obtain your ClearSale App Key. This key is required to initialize the SDK.\n* Have a working integration of the Yuno Payments SDK in your Android project.\n* Ensure the project meets the general requirements for Yuno Android SDKs.\n\n## Adding the YunoAntiFraud ClearSale library to the project\n\nAdd the YunoAntiFraud ClearSale dependency to the application `build.gradle` file:\n\nGradle\n\n```\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'com.yuno.fraud-prevention:clearsale:{last_version}'\n}\n```\n\n## Permissions\n\nWe include the INTERNET permission by default as ClearSale needs them,\n\nXML\n\n```\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\"/>\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE\"/>\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\"/>\n```\n\n### Optional\n\nIf you want to include location data, you must add the location permissions to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:\n\nXML\n\n```\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION\"/>\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION\"/>\n```\n\nAnd you must add the location dependencies to your app's `build.gradle`:\n\nGradle\n\n```\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-location:17.0.0'\n}\n```\n\n## Step 1: Include the library\n\nAdd the ClearSale SDK as a dependency in your Gradle configuration:\n\nGradle\n\n```\ndependencies {\n    implementation \"com.yuno.fraud-prevention:clearsale:{last_version}\"\n}\n```\n\nYou must also include the Yuno Payments SDK to handle payment flows.\n\n## Step 2: Initialize ClearSale SDK\n\nThe ClearSale SDK requires explicit lifecycle integration. You must call the provided functions from your Activity or Fragment lifecycle methods.\n\n### Initialize the SDK\n\nCall `onCreateYunoClearSale()` in your `onCreate()` method (Activity) or `onCreateView()` (Fragment):\n\nKotlin\n\n```\noverride fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)\n    onCreateYunoClearSale(\"<your-clear-sale-app-key>\")\n}\n```\n\n### Start session and collect device information\n\nCall `onResumeYunoClearSale()` in your `onResume()` method. This function generates a new `sessionId`, starts data collection, and returns the `sessionId` string:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\noverride fun onResume() {\n    super.onResume()\n    val sessionId = onResumeYunoClearSale()\n}\n```\n\nYou should persist this `sessionId` (for example, in your app state or backend) so it can later be passed to the Yuno Payments SDK.\n\n### Stop ClearSale session\n\nCall `onStopYunoClearSale()` in your `onStop()` method to release resources:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\noverride fun onStop() {\n    super.onStop()\n    onStopYunoClearSale()\n}\n```\n\n## Step 3: Share the ClearSale Session ID with Yuno Payments\n\nThe `sessionId` generated by ClearSale must be shared with the Yuno Payments SDK to complete the fraud-prevention integration. Pass the `sessionId` to the `merchantSessionId` parameter when starting the checkout flow:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nstartPayment(\n    callbackOTT = { oneTimeToken ->\n        // ...\n    },\n    merchantSessionId = sessionId,\n    // ...\n)\n\n// or\n\nstartPaymentLite(\n    callbackOTT = { oneTimeToken ->\n        // ...\n    },\n    merchantSessionId = sessionId,\n    // ...\n)\n```\n\n## Summary of Lifecycle Calls\n\n* `onCreateYunoClearSale(appKey)` → Call once in `onCreate()`\n* `onResumeYunoClearSale()` → Call in `onResume()` to generate and retrieve `sessionId`\n* `onStopYunoClearSale()` → Call in `onStop()` to stop session tracking\n\nUpdated about 1 month ago\n\n---\n\n[Headless SDK (Payment Android)](/docs/headless-sdk-payment-android)[SDK Customizations](/docs/sdk-customizations-android)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Requirements](#requirements)\n  + [Adding the YunoAntiFraud ClearSale library to the project](#adding-the-yunoantifraud-clearsale-library-to-the-project)\n  + [Permissions](#permissions)\n  + - [Optional](#optional)\n  + [Step 1: Include the library](#step-1-include-the-library)\n  + [Step 2: Initialize ClearSale SDK](#step-2-initialize-clearsale-sdk)\n  + - [Initialize the SDK](#initialize-the-sdk)\n    - [Start session and collect device information](#start-session-and-collect-device-information)\n    - [Stop ClearSale session](#stop-clearsale-session)\n  + [Step 3: Share the ClearSale Session ID with Yuno Payments](#step-3-share-the-clearsale-session-id-with-yuno-payments)\n  + [Summary of Lifecycle Calls](#summary-of-lifecycle-calls)", "images": [], "source": "Yuno Docs"}
{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/lite-checkout-android", "title": "Lite SDK (Payment Android)", "content_markdown": "# Lite SDK (Payment Android)\n\n> 👍\n>\n> ### Recommended SDK\n>\n> We recommend using the [Android Seamless SDK](seamless-sdk-payment-android) for a smooth integration experience. This option provides a flexible payment solution with pre-built UI components and customization options.\n\nThis page provides a guide to the Yuno Lite SDK for Android payments. This SDK offers a streamlined integration process with essential payment functionality, making it ideal for merchants who:\n\n* Need a quick implementation with minimal customization requirements\n* Want to focus primarily on card payment processing\n* Prefer a ready-to-use UI that handles the payment flow\n\nThe Lite SDK includes core features like:\n\n* Pre-built payment UI components\n* Card payment processing\n* Basic payment status handling\n* Essential error management\n\nFor merchants requiring more advanced features like multiple payment methods, custom UI, or advanced fraud prevention, consider using our [Full SDK](/docs/full-checkout-android) instead.\n\n## Requirements\n\nBefore starting the Yuno Android SDK integration, ensure your project meets the [technical requirements](/docs/requirements-android). Also, ensure the following prerequisites are in place:\n\n* You must have an active Yuno account.\n* You need your Yuno API credentials (`account_id`, `public-api-key`, and `private-secret-key`), which you can obtain from the [Developers credentials section](../docs/developers-credentials) of the Yuno dashboard. These credentials are required to authenticate requests to the Yuno API. The API is used to:\n  + Create a `customer`, which is required before initiating payments\n  + Create a `checkout_session`, which initializes the payment flow\n  + Create the payment associated with the session\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### SDK Version\n>\n> See the [Release notes](#docs/release-notes-android-sdk) or the [Yuno Android SDK repository](https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-android) to verify the current SDK version available.\n\n## Step 1: Create a customer\n\nCreate a customer using the [Create customer endpoint](/reference/create-customer) before initiating payments. This step is required to:\n\n* Identify the person making the payment\n* Enable saved card functionality (if enabled)\n* Track payment history\n\nThe customer ID returned from this endpoint will be used when creating the `checkout_session`.\n\n## Step 2: Create a checkout session\n\nCreate a new `checkout_session` using the [Create checkout session](/reference/create-checkout-session) endpoint to initialize the payment flow. Make sure to:\n\n* Include the customer ID obtained from the previous step\n* Store the returned `checkout_session` ID for use in Step 5 of the integration\n* The `checkout_session` is unique for each payment attempt and cannot be reused\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### External Browser Return Handling\n>\n> If your payment flow sends users to an external browser (for example, for 3DS authentication or bank redirects), make sure to set the `callback_url` when creating your checkout session. For a step-by-step guide on handling the return to your app, see [Handle external browser return (callback\\_url)](../docs/external-browser-callback-android).\n\n## Step 3: Include the library in your project\n\nInclude the Yuno SDK file in your project through Gradle. Add the repository source:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nmaven { url \"https://yunopayments.jfrog.io/artifactory/snapshots-libs-release\" }\n```\n\nInclude the following code in the `build.gradle` file to add the Yuno SDK dependency to the application:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'com.yuno.payments:android-sdk:{last_version}'\n}\n```\n\n### Permissions\n\nThe Yuno SDK includes the `INTERNET` permission by default, which is required to make network requests.\n\nXML\n\n```\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" />\n```\n\n## Step 4: Initialize SDK with the public key\n\nInitialize the SDK:\n\n1. Get your public API keys from the [Yuno dashboard](https://dashboard.y.uno/)\n2. Create a custom application class if you don't have one\n3. Initialize the SDK by calling `Yuno.initialize()` in your application's `onCreate()` method, passing your API key and configuration:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nclass CustomApplication : Application() {\n  override fun onCreate() {\n    super.onCreate()\n    Yuno.initialize(\n      this,\n      PUBLIC_API_KEY,\n      config: YunoConfig,\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\n\nUse the data class `YunoConfig` to customize the SDK's behavior. Include this configuration when calling `Yuno.initialize()`. The available options are:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\ndata class YunoConfig(\n    val cardFlow: CardFormType = CardFormType.ONE_STEP,\n    val saveCardEnabled: Boolean = false,\n    val cardFormDeployed: Boolean = false,\n    val language: YunoLanguage? = null,\n    val styles: YunoStyles? = null\n)\n```\n\nThe following table describes each customization option:\n\n| Customization option | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| **cardFlow** | This optional configuration defines Payment and Enrollment Card flow. By default, the `CardFormType.ONE_STEP` option is used. See the [Render options](#render-options) section for more information. |\n| **saveCardEnabled** | Enables the **Save card checkbox** on card flows. See the [Save card](#save-card-for-future-payments) section for more information. |\n| **language** | Defines the language to be used in the payment forms. You can set it to one of the available language options:  * es (Spanish) * en (English) * pt (Portuguese) * fil (Filipino) * id (Indonesian) * ms (Malay) * th (Thai) * zh-TW (Chinese (Traditional, Taiwan)) * zh-CN (Chinese (Simplified, China)) * vi (Vietnamese) * fr (French) * pl (Polish) * it (Italian) * de (German) * ru (Russian) * tr (Turkish) * nl (Dutch) * sv (Swedish) * ko (Korean) * ja (Japanese) |\n| **styles** | Enables SDK-wide UI customization. Use it to define global visual styles like font family and button appearance (color, padding, radius, typography) through a `YunoStyles` object. For more information, see the [`styles`](../docs/full-checkout-android#styles) section. |\n\nYou also need to update your manifest to use your application:\n\nXML\n\n```\n<application android:name=\".CustomApplication\"></application>\n```\n\n## Step 5: Start the checkout process\n\nCall the `startCheckout` method in the `onCreate()` function of the activity that integrates the SDK to initiate a new payment process with the Lite SDK:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nstartCheckout(\n  checkoutSession: \"checkout_session\",\n  countryCode: \"US\",\n  callbackPaymentState: ((String?) -> Unit)?,\n  merchantSessionId: String? = null\n)\n```\n\nThe following table describes the required parameters to start the checkout:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `checkoutSession` | A unique identifier for the checkout session associated with the payment. It is required to initialize the payment process and grants access to the customer's available payment methods. |\n| `countryCode` | Country code where the payment is performed. See [Country coverage](/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk) for a complete list of supported countries and their codes. |\n| `callbackPaymentState` | It's a function that returns the current payment process. Sending this function is not mandatory if you do not need the result. |\n| `merchantSessionId` | An identifier used by the merchant to track the payment. |\n\n### Callback Payment State\n\nThe `callbackPaymentState` parameter is a function that returns the current payment process. Sending this function is not mandatory if you do not need the result. The following code block shows the possible states:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nconst val PAYMENT_STATE_SUCCEEDED = \"SUCCEEDED\"\nconst val PAYMENT_STATE_FAIL = \"FAIL\"\nconst val PAYMENT_STATE_PROCESSING = \"PROCESSING\"\nconst val PAYMENT_STATE_REJECT = \"REJECT\"\nconst val PAYMENT_STATE_INTERNAL_ERROR = \"INTERNAL_ERROR\"\nconst val PAYMENT_STATE_STATE_CANCELED_BY_USER = \"CANCELED\"\n```\n\nThe following table provides additional information about the possible states:\n\n| **State** | **Description** | **Additional action required** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `SUCCEEDED` | The transaction or payment process was successfully completed without any errors. | No. |\n| `FAIL` | The transaction failed due to errors such as data validation issues, server connection failures, or technical/network problems. | Yes. Investigate the cause of failure (validation, network, server) and take corrective measures. |\n| `PROCESSING` | The transaction is currently in progress, awaiting approval or verification. | No. |\n| `REJECT` | The transaction was rejected due to reasons like insufficient funds or suspected fraudulent activity. | Yes. Inform the user of the rejection, provide the reason if possible, and suggest actions. |\n| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | An unexpected internal error occurred within the system handling the payment process. | Yes. Requires technical intervention to review the system, fix internal issues, and retry or inform the user. |\n| `CANCELED` | The user voluntarily canceled the transaction or abandoned the payment process. | No. |\n\n## Step 6: Initiate the payment process\n\nCall the method `startPaymentLite` to start a payment process:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nstartPaymentLite(\n    paymentSelected: PaymentSelected,\n    callbackOTT:(String?) -> Unit,\n    callBackTokenWithInformation:(OneTimeTokenModel?) -> Unit,\n    showPaymentStatus: Boolean,\n)\n```\n\nThe following table describes the required parameters to start the payment:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `paymentSelected` | Inform the payment method selected by the buyer. |\n| `showStatusYuno` | A boolean that specifies whether the payment status should be displayed within the Yuno interface. |\n| `callbackOTT` | A required function that returns the updated one-time token needed to complete the payment process. |\n| `callBackTokenWithInformation` | A function that supplies detailed information about the one-time token, wrapped in a `OneTimeTokenModel` object, allowing for comprehensive handling of token details. |\n\nSend an additional parameter, which is the vaulted token and/or the payment type that the user selected to make the payment:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nPaymentSelected(\n  vaultedToken : String \"payment_vaulted_token\",\n  paymentMethodType : String \"payment_type\",\n)\n```\n\n## Step 7: Get the OTT (one-time token)\n\nThe one-time token is a unique identifier that represents a payment session. This token is required to create a payment.\n\n#### Callback one-time token\n\nThe one-time token callback returns the following parameters:\n\n| Parameter | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| oneTimeToken | String | one-time token generated for the payment session |\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Loader Handling\n>\n> The merchant is responsible for handling the loader. Yuno offers an option to use our loader; however, the merchant can use their own loader and must make the corresponding configurations.\n\n## Step 8: Create the payment\n\nAfter completing the previous steps, create a payment by calling the [Create Payment endpoint](/reference/create-payment) from your backend. This endpoint requires:\n\n* The one-time token obtained in Step 7\n* The `checkout_session` obtained in Step 2\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Continue Payment Method Integration\n>\n> Yuno **requires** you integrate the `continuePayment` method of the SDK after the payment is created because certain asynchronous payment methods require additional action from the customer to complete it. The API will inform you of this scenario via the `sdk_action_required` field of the response, which will be returned as true. The `yuno.continuePayment()` function will display the additional screens to the customers, where they can carry out the necessary actions to complete the payment without needing you to handle every scenario.\n\nFor payment methods that require additional customer actions (such as 3DS authentication challenges) or asynchronous processing (like bank transfers), you'll need to integrate the SDK's `continuePayment` method after creating the payment. The Create Payment API response includes a `sdk_action_required` field that indicates whether this step is needed:\n\n* If `TRUE`: Call `yuno.continuePayment()` to display additional screens for customer actions (e.g., 3DS authentication, bank redirect pages)\n* If `FALSE`: Skip this step as no additional customer interaction is required\n\nThe following code block shows how to implement the payment continuation flow:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\ncontinuePayment(\n    showPaymentStatus: Boolean = true,\n    checkoutSession: String? = null,\n    countryCode: String? = null,\n    callbackPaymentState: ((String?) -> Unit)? = null\n)\n```\n\nSend `FALSE` in the `showPaymentStatus` parameter to show your payment status screens. Then, get the payment state by callback.\n\n## Click to Pay (CTP) with Passkey\n\nUnlike other processes, when a user completes a payment using CTP Passkey, the *One-Time Token* (`OTT`) will not be received through the usual callback methods. The OTT will be delivered via the **deeplink URL** in the Intent. Your app must read it from the `Intent`, create the payment on your backend, and then continue the flow with the SDK.\n\n### 1. AndroidManifest (deeplink)\n\nAdd an `intent-filter` to your main activity in `AndroidManifest.xml`:\n\nXML\n\n```\n<activity android:name=\".CheckoutActivity\" android:exported=\"true\">\n  <intent-filter>\n    <action android:name=\"android.intent.action.VIEW\" />\n    <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.DEFAULT\" />\n    <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.BROWSABLE\" />\n    <!-- Adjust to your actual scheme/host -->\n    <data android:scheme=\"myapp\" android:host=\"pay\" android:pathPrefix=\"/ctp\" />\n  </intent-filter>\n</activity>\n```\n\nAdjust the `scheme`, `host`, and `pathPrefix` to match your app's configuration.\n\n### 2. Handle the Intent\n\nIn your activity, handle the Intent in both `onCreate()` and `onNewIntent()`:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nclass CheckoutActivity : AppCompatActivity() {\n    \n    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)\n        initYuno()\n        startCheckout()\n        // Initialize your SDK / UI\n        handleDeeplink(intent)\n    }\n\n    override fun onNewIntent(intent: Intent) {\n        super.onNewIntent(intent)\n        setIntent(intent)\n        handleDeeplink(intent)\n    }\n\n    private fun handleDeeplink(intent: Intent?) {\n        val uri = intent?.data ?: return\n\n        when {\n            // Cancellation or error\n            uri.getBooleanQueryParameter(\"has_error\", false) -> {\n                val message = uri.getQueryParameter(\"message\") ?: \"Operation canceled\"\n                showError(message)\n            }\n\n            // Success: OTT received in URL\n            uri.getQueryParameter(\"one_time_token\") != null -> {\n                val ott = extractOtt(uri) ?: return\n                val checkoutSession = extractCheckoutSession(uri)\n\n                // 1) Send the OTT to your backend to create the payment\n                createPaymentOnBackend(ott) { success ->\n                    if (success && checkoutSession != null) {\n                        // 2) Then continue the flow in the SDK\n                        continuePayment(\n                            checkoutSession = checkoutSession,\n                            countryCode = currentCountry\n                        ) { result ->\n                            // Handle payment state\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    \n    private fun extractOtt(uri: Uri): String? =\n        uri.getQueryParameter(\"one_time_token\")\n\n    private fun extractCheckoutSession(uri: Uri): String? =\n        uri.getQueryParameter(\"checkout_session\")\n            ?: uri.getQueryParameter(\"checkoutSession\")\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Create the Payment (Backend)\n\nOnce you extract the **OTT** from the deeplink, create the payment on your backend using the [Create Payment endpoint](/reference/create-payment).\n\nAfter receiving a successful response from your backend (payment created), continue the flow in the SDK by calling `continuePayment()`.\n\n### 4. Helper Functions\n\nCreate helper functions to extract parameters from the Intent URI:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nprivate fun extractOtt(uri: Uri): String? =\n    uri.getQueryParameter(\"one_time_token\")\n\nprivate fun extractCheckoutSession(uri: Uri): String? =\n    uri.getQueryParameter(\"checkout_session\")\n        ?: uri.getQueryParameter(\"checkoutSession\")\n```\n\n> 💡\n>\n> ### Tip\n>\n> In QA environments, log the complete URL to verify the parameter names.\n\n### 5. Quick Testing\n\nYou can test the CTP Passkey flow using these sample deeplink URLs:\n\n* **Success:** `myapp://pay/ctp?one_time_token=OTT_123&checkout_session=CHK_456`\n* **Error:** `myapp://pay/ctp?has_error=true&message=User%20canceled`\n* **Continuation:** `myapp://pay/ctp`\n\n### 6. Checklist\n\nUse this checklist to ensure proper CTP Passkey integration:\n\n* ✅ `intent-filter` configured correctly (scheme/host/path)\n* ✅ `handleDeeplink` implemented in both `onCreate()` and `onNewIntent()`\n* ✅ Extract both `one_time_token` and `checkout_session` parameters\n* ✅ Create payment on backend with **OTT** ➜ call `continuePayment(...)`\n* ✅ Handle `has_error` and `message` parameters for error scenarios\n\n> ⚠️\n>\n> ### Important\n>\n> The OTT will **not** be received through the `callbackOTT` function for CTP Passkey payments. You must extract the token from the Intent URI parameters instead.\n\n## Render Mode (advanced integration)\n\nFor developers requiring advanced UI control, the Lite SDK also supports render mode integration. This mode provides fragment-based UI components that you can integrate into custom layouts, offering more flexibility while maintaining the streamlined Lite SDK functionality.\n\n### Basic render mode setup\n\nUse `startPaymentRender` for advanced UI integration:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nfun Activity.startPaymentRender(\n    checkoutSession: String? = null,\n    countryCode: String? = null,\n    coroutineScope: CoroutineScope,\n    paymentSelected: PaymentSelected,\n    listener: YunoPaymentRenderListener,\n): YunoPaymentFragmentController\n```\n\n### Implementation example\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nclass PaymentActivity : Activity() {\n\n    private lateinit var fragmentController: YunoPaymentFragmentController\n\n    private fun initializeRenderMode() {\n        fragmentController = startPaymentRender(\n            checkoutSession = checkoutSessionId,\n            countryCode = \"US\",\n            coroutineScope = lifecycleScope,\n            paymentSelected = PaymentSelected.CARD,\n            listener = object : YunoPaymentRenderListener {\n                override fun showView(fragment: Fragment) {\n                    supportFragmentManager.beginTransaction()\n                        .replace(R.id.payment_container, fragment)\n                        .commit()\n                }\n\n                override fun returnOneTimeToken(oneTimeToken: String, additionalData: OneTimeTokenModel?) {\n                    processPayment(oneTimeToken) {\n                        fragmentController.continuePayment()\n                    }\n                }\n\n                override fun returnStatus(resultCode: Int, paymentStatus: String) {\n                    handlePaymentResult(paymentStatus)\n                }\n\n                override fun loadingListener(isLoading: Boolean) {\n                    updateLoadingUI(isLoading)\n                }\n            }\n        )\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Key benefits\n\n* **Custom UI Integration**: Embed payment components in your existing layouts\n* **Fragment Compatibility**: Works with both XML and Jetpack Compose\n* **Flow Control**: Manage form submission and payment continuation manually\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Advanced Feature\n>\n> Render mode is designed for developers who need custom UI integration. For simpler implementations, use the standard Lite SDK methods described in the previous steps.\n\n## Complementary features\n\nYuno Android SDK provides additional services and configurations you can use to improve customers' experience. Use the [SDK customization](/docs/sdk-customizations-android) to change the SDK appearance to match your brand or to configure the loader.\n\n### `styles`\n\nWith the `styles` customization option, you can define global visual styles through a `YunoStyles` object. It lets you apply consistent branding across the SDK by customizing button appearance and typography.\n\nKotlin\n\n```\ndata class YunoStyles(\n    val buttonStyles: YunoButtonStyles? = null,\n    val fontFamily: FontFamily? = null\n)\n```\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `buttonStyles` | Customizes the primary buttons displayed in the SDK. |\n| `fontFamily` | Sets the font family used across all SDK text elements. |\n\nThe `YunoButtonStyles` object lets you define specific settings for button appearance:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\ndata class YunoButtonStyles(\n    val backgroundColor: Color? = null,\n    val contentColor: Color? = null,\n    val cornerRadius: Dp? = null,\n    val elevation: Dp? = null,\n    val padding: Dp? = null,\n    val fontFamily: FontFamily? = null,\n    val fontSize: TextUnit? = null,\n    val fontStyle: FontStyle? = null\n)\n```\n\nUse the `YunoConfig` data class, described in Step 4, to use the `styles` customization option.\n\n### Loader\n\nThe loader functionality is controlled through the `keepLoader` parameter in the `YunoConfig` data class, which is documented inline in the SDK configuration section above.\n\n### Save card for future payments\n\nYou can also display a checkbox to save or enroll cards using `cardSaveEnable: true`. The following examples show the checkbox for both card form renders:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/1c3d62f0307923298b22f18a1e58f86f8b6068a582315a0991ff8d802c475dbc-Card___save_for_future_payments.png)\n\n### Render options\n\nYou can choose between two card form render options. The following screenshots show the difference between `cardFormType` `ONE_STEP` and `STEP_BY_STEP`:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/7525725793bb95941157225f086e5abaa58875401b435703e4d3e69e217ca690-Full_SDK_android.png)\n\n### SDK customization\n\nYou can change the SDK appearance to match your brand.

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/seamless-sdk", "title": "Seamless SDK", "content_markdown": "# Seamless SDK\n\nYuno's **Seamless SDK** provides a simple and efficient integration while giving you full control over the payment experience. Like the [Lite SDK](/docs/the-ultimate-checkout-lite), it allows you to retrieve available payment methods and decide which to display during checkout. Once the selection is made, a single API and SDK call completes the payment process, creating an experience identical to the Lite SDK.\n\nWhen using the Seamless SDK, you can:\n\n* Execute the payment process.\n* Enroll a credit card while making a payment.\n* Use a vaulted token from an enrolled payment method to complete a payment.\n\nUse the following guides to implement each process.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/bb2c987a467228d113d98035f453a459aedfb41554aad3eb49fc50fed8dbf0a0-Screenshot_2025-06-04_at_10.45.05_AM.png)\n\n## Payment workflow\n\nThe diagram below illustrates the complete payment workflow:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/aa0edc30b1470562f8cc1380856aacb410d41aa6417d863e2c65476d26481fa4-image1.png)\n\n### SDK Headless Payment Flow\n\nThis diagram illustrates the headless payment process using the SDK, detailing the interactions between the Merchant Client, Merchant Server, Yuno Server, and Yuno SDK.

It handles the user-facing aspects of the payment flow, including:\n\n* List payment method\n* User selects payment methods\n* Initiate SDK with checkout session and `payment_method`\n\n#### Merchant Server\n\nThe Merchant Server represents your backend application that handles server-side operations and communicates with Yuno's servers. Its key responsibilities include:\n\n* Create `checkout_session`\n* Receive webhook with payment result\n\n#### Yuno Server\n\nThe Yuno Server handles all backend operations related to customer management, checkout sessions, and payment processing. Its main responsibilities include:\n\n* Creates `checkout_session`\n* Create payment\n* Sends webhook with payment result\n\n#### Yuno SDK\n\nThe Yuno SDK handles the user interface and payment flow on the client side, managing payment method selection, token generation, and payment completion. Its key responsibilities include:\n\n* Initiate SDK with `checkout_session and payment_method`\n* Generate OTT\n* Continue payment automatic if necessary\n* Shows screens for user to complete enrollment\n* Display payment method result (optional)\n\n#### Flow\n\nThe following steps outline the complete interaction flow between all components of the SDK Headless Payment integration, detailing how each request and response moves through the system:\n\n1.

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/how-yuno-payment-flow-works", "title": "How the Yuno Payment Process Works", "content_markdown": "# How the Yuno Payment Process Works\n\nWhile Yuno provides diverse payment options, the basic payment process always follows the same sequence. This guide provides a step-by-step breakdown of the process and key elements involved, clarifying how payments flow when utilizing Yuno's SDKs or API.\n\n## The Yuno payment process\n\nThe payment process consists of four steps:\n\n1. [Create a customer](#step-1-create-a-customer)\n2. [Create a checkout session](#step-2-create-a-checkout-session)\n3. [Create a one-time token](#step-3-create-a-one-time-token)\n4. [Create the payment](#step-4-create-the-payment)\n\nA successful [payment](/docs/payments-1) leads to a completed [transaction](/docs/transactions) based on the customer's payment details and available funds.\n\nThe steps below explain each part of the process in detail.\n\n### Step 1: Create a customer\n\nEvery payment in Yuno links to a [customer](/docs/customers). The system stores customer details such as name, address, and phone number. Yuno uses this information to process payments across different [payment methods](/docs/payment-methods) and processors. Payment methods can be enrolled in customer profiles.\n\nWhen you create a customer, Yuno generates a unique identifier for use in later steps. Although some details are optional, adding a phone number, billing address, and shipping address can improve the user's payment experience.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Note\n>\n> You will need the customer's identification information for each subsequent step.\n\n### Step 2: Create a checkout session\n\nTo process a payment, create a [checkout session](/docs/sessions#checkout-session). This session connects the customer to the payment and stores key transaction details.\n\nWhen you create a checkout session, Yuno loads all available [payment methods](/docs/payment-methods) linked to your account. You can present these options to your customer at checkout. After they select a payment method, proceed to the next step.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Enroll a payment method\n>\n> If your customer wishes to enroll a payment method to their profile, you'll create a [customer session](/docs/sessions#customer-session) instead of a checkout session. When your customers enroll in a payment method, they provide important information such as card number and CVV only once. Yuno receives and stores payment information from your customers and their preferences for future use.\n\n### Step 3: Create a one-time token\n\nA [one-time token](/docs/tokens) (OTT) enhances payment security by protecting sensitive customer information. This temporary code ensures privacy during transactions.\n\nTo generate an one-time token, provide:\n\n* The customer's identification\n* The associated checkout session\n* The selected [payment method](/docs/payment-methods)\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Info\n>\n> A one-time token (OTT) is a temporary, single-use code that prevents unauthorized reuse. It enhances security by ensuring each transaction is unique, blocking fraud and unauthorized access.\n\nYuno securely generates the one-time token, preventing sensitive details from being stored on your servers. This method adds a layer of security and simplifies recurring payments by keeping payment information safe for future use.\n\n### Step 4: Create the payment\n\nA [payment](/docs/payments-1) represents a customer's transaction on Yuno's platform, consolidating all necessary order details.\n\nTo process a payment, use the data collected in the previous steps. The transaction must occur within a checkout session and include:\n\n* A connected customer\n* A valid one-time token for security\n\nThe payment entity organizes transaction details, ensuring a clear and structured payment flow. This setup simplifies tracking and reconciliation.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Enhance the customer's experience\n>\n> When creating a payment, certain fields are optional but can enhance user experience if completed. Make sure to consider mandatory fields if you decide to include this information.\n\nAfter creating the payment, Yuno will keep you informed about updates through [webhooks](/docs/webhooks-1). Additionally, Yuno offers [fraud prevention](/docs/fraud) solutions that you can integrate into the payment process.\n\nUpdated 6 months ago\n\n---\n\n[What is Yuno?](/docs/what-is-yuno)[Basic Concepts](/docs/basic-concepts)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [The Yuno payment process](#the-yuno-payment-process)\n  + - [Step 1: Create a customer](#step-1-create-a-customer)\n    - [Step 2: Create a checkout session](#step-2-create-a-checkout-session)\n    - [Step 3: Create a one-time token](#step-3-create-a-one-time-token)\n    - [Step 4: Create the payment](#step-4-create-the-payment)", "images": [], "source": "Yuno Docs"}
{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/sdk-customizations", "title": "SDK Customizations", "content_markdown": "# SDK Customizations\n\nThe Yuno Web SDK allows you to customize various elements, making it easy to align the design of payment forms and the checkout flow with your brand guidelines and UX/UI. Although the structure of each element remains uniform, you can adjust colors, text, buttons, and much more.\n\n## General guidelines\n\n* **Styles within an iframe**: Define the new styles when initializing the SDK. Each form input that receives card information is rendered within an iframe when using the Form Card Modal.\n* **Styles outside an iframe**: Inject the styles directly into the page.\n* **Check element structure**: Use the browser's developer mode to inspect where the element is rendered.\n\n## Default and Deprecated Design\n\nUse the Default Design information when customizing the Yuno Web SDK. This approach is recommended for all new customizations and ensures you use the most up-to-date styles and practices.\n\nThe Deprecated Design is available for Yuno clients needing access to CSS class information. However, this option will be removed in the future.\n\n## Customizable elements\n\nThe following sections detail the elements that make up the Card and APM forms, along with the respective classes for each one, which can be modified to achieve a personalized style. Use the tab selector to choose between the Default and Deprecated content:\n\nDefault\nDeprecated\n\nUse the following links to navigate to the desired component:\n\n* [Input](#default-input)\n* [Dropdown](#default-dropdown)\n* [Checkbox](#default-checkbox)\n* [Button](#default-button)\n* [Card](#default-card)\n* [Alert](#default-alert)\n* [Modal](#default-modal)\n\n+ [Form Card Modal](#default-form-card-modal)\n+ [APM Modal](#default-apm-modal)\n\n### Input\n\nThe following table lists the classes available for customizing the input element while using the Default Design:\n\n| CSS Class | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `.Yuno-fieldset__box` | General container for input fields. |\n| `.Yuno-input__content` | Content area for input elements. |\n| `.Yuno-input__label` | Label for input elements. |\n| `.Yuno-input__base` | Base styling for input elements. |\n\nThe images below show how each class will affect the input element.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/writechoiceorg/yuno-images/main/doc/SDKs/webSDK/customization-SDK-defaults/input-default-1.png)\n\nYou can also customize the error warnings flagged by the interface.

This helps improve customer experience by automatically releasing held funds. Learn more in the [Cancel and Capture Flow](/docs/cancel-and-capture-flow) guide.\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Cancellable Payments\n>\n> Only payments with **PENDING** status can be canceled. Check the [Payment status](../docs/payment-status) page for further details regarding the possible payment status.\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo cancel a payment, you need to:\n\n* Access your [API credentials](/docs/developers-credentials) on the Yuno Dashboard, which consist of:\n  + `public-api-key`\n  + `private-secrete-key`\n* Have the payment identification data received after creating the payment using the [Create Payment endpoint](/reference/create-payment):\n  + `id`: The unique identifier of the payment, obtained from the parameter `id` after creating the payment.\n  + `transaction_id`: The unique identifier of the transaction obtained from the parameter `transaction.id` after creating the payment.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Explore Yuno Postman Collections\n>\n> Yuno provides [Postman Collections](/reference/postman-collections) that you can use to replicate the use cases locally.\n\n## Cancel a Payment\n\nYou can cancel a payment only if it has the PENDING status. Use the [Cancel Payment endpoint](/reference/cancel-payment) to cancel the payment. To identify the payment to be canceled, you need to provide its `id` and the `transaction_id`.\n\nTo confirm you have successfully canceled the payment, check if the parameters from the [Cancel Payment endpoint](/reference/cancel-payment) response contain the following values:\n\n* `type = CANCEL`\n* `status = SUCCEEDED`\n* `payment.status = CANCELED`\n* `payment.sub_status = CANCELED`\n\nIf the response contains the above values, the cancellation was successful.\n\n### Check the payment status\n\nIf, for some reason, you need to confirm the payment cancelation:\n\n* Use the [Retrieve Payment by ID](/reference/retrieve-payment-by-id) or [Retrieve Payment by merchant\\_order\\_id](/reference/retrieve-payment-by-merchant-order-id) to get detailed information about the payment.\n* Alternatively, set up webhooks to receive notifications for each event.

You can configure both **pre-authorization** and **post-authorization** fraud screening through your preferred **fraud detection provider**.\n\n### Fraud prevention with Yuno\n\nWhen using Yuno's SDK, no additional development is required. Simply add the fraud detection provider to the payment route, and Yuno will handle the rest.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/2c9a0ed-Fraud_prevention_.png)\n\nWhen a payment is created, Yuno generates different transactions based on the payment method route. If fraud verification is enabled in the route, Yuno creates a `FRAUD_SCREENING` transaction and associates it with the payment. This transaction contains details about the fraud verification outcome, which you can also view in the [payment details](/docs/transactions#transaction-types-and-statuses) on your Yuno dashboard.\n\nUpdated 6 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Webhooks](/docs/webhooks-1)[3DS](/docs/3ds-1)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Fraud prevention with Yuno](#fraud-prevention-with-yuno)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/2c9a0ed-Fraud_prevention_.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/2c9a0ed-Fraud_prevention_.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a blue square with a magni and a magni on it"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}
{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/webhooks", "title": "Webhooks Overview", "content_markdown": "# Webhooks Overview\n\n## What is a webhook\n\nWebhooks enable apps to provide real-time information whenever an event happens without needing constant requests. They are a passive method to receive data between two systems through an HTTP POST. After configuring the Yuno webhooks, you will receive event notifications every time an activity or a function is generated within the Yuno flow.\n\n## Why do we recommend you use webhooks?\n\nWebhooks are the best way to ensure your system is up-to-date with payment progress and status. Since the event notifications trigger automatically, your system won't need to perform recurrent requests to Yuno. You will process the payment information on demand.\n\n## What do you need to know before start using webhooks?\n\nTo start using Yuno’s webhooks, you need to build a public REST API to receive event notifications (POST request). That means the REST API you will build should not require any authentication or access restriction through a header. Despite using a public API, the communication system is very safe since Yuno event notifications will not be available to the public and will use a unique URL to communicate only to your REST API.\n\n## Webhooks Delivery and Response Requirements\n\nYuno webhooks expects to receive an **HTTP 200 OK** status as a response to confirm the webhook was successfully received. The merchant system does not need to include any information in the response's body. Only the HTTP 200 status is required.\n\nIf no response is received within the specified time, Yuno will retry sending the event notification up to seven times to ensure no information is lost. Refer to the [Receipt Confirmation Process](../docs/configure-webhooks#receipt-confirmation-process) section for details on the notification schedule and confirmation waiting times for each retry.\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Chargeback Response Codes](/docs/reason-codes)[Configure Webhooks](/docs/configure-webhooks)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [What is a webhook](#what-is-a-webhook)\n  + [Why do we recommend you use webhooks?](#why-do-we-recommend-you-use-webhooks)\n  + [What do you need to know before start using webhooks?](#what-do-you-need-to-know-before-start-using-webhooks)\n  + [Webhooks Delivery and Response Requirements](#webhooks-delivery-and-response-requirements)", "images": [], "source": "Yuno Docs"}
{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/network-token-migration-process", "title": "Network Token Migration Process", "content_markdown": "# Network Token Migration Process\n\nNetwork Token migration is the process of transferring `network_tokens` from an existing provider to Yuno's secure vault. During this process, a new token is generated for each `network_token`, ensuring seamless continuity and security for payment processing. The `network_token` migration process consists of three main steps:\n\n1. The merchant requests the `network_token` migration process from their current payment processor.\n2. Yuno and the payment provider collaborate to securely import all `network_token` data into the Yuno vault.\n3. The merchant uses Yuno's token migration API to map the `network_tokens` from the payment provider to the `network_vaulted_tokens` of Yuno.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### First step\n>\n> To initiate the `network_token` migration process, contact your business advisor at Yuno to assess the viability and schedule of the procedure.\n\n## Importing network token from a gateway account (steps 1 and 2)\n\nImporting `network_token` data from a gateway account involves handling sensitive information, so strict security protocols must be followed. To import `network_token` data into Yuno from an existing gateway, complete the following steps:\n\n1. **Coordinate with the current gateway**: Contact your current third-party vault or gateway and request an export of the payment method data. Ensure you follow their specified protocols.\n2. **Complete the formal request**: Submit a formal request to Yuno, ensuring all required details and processes are documented. The gateway's response time and procedures will determine the data transfer process.\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Your responsibilities when migrating tokens\n>\n> You are responsible for managing communication with your gateway provider throughout the migration process. The Yuno team will support and collaborate directly with the third-party vault/gateway to facilitate the importing process. Additionally, the customer subscription information, including amounts, dates, etc., must be obtained directly from the exporting entity, as Yuno will not extract this data from encrypted files.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Data transfer security\n>\n> All data throughout the migration process is encrypted using PGP keys and transferred using SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol).\n\n## Client-side requirements (step 3)\n\nTo successfully complete the token migration process, it is essential to fulfill the client-side requirements outlined in step 3. This involves providing the necessary user data, including the buyers and their existing payment methods.\n\nYou can execute the token migration process using the Yuno API, which is specifically designed for merchants. As a merchant, you will use this API to:\n\n1. **Add customers**: Register customers in the Yuno system.\n2. **Enroll payment methods**: Register payment methods obtained from payment processors for each customer in the Yuno system.\n\nFor a detailed guide on performing token migration using the API, click the button below:\n\n[#### Token migration via API](via-api)\n\n## Gateway and payment provider requirements\n\nTo proceed with the migration process, you will need to provide the following:\n\n* A public SSH key (you can provide one for production and another for testing).

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/headless-sdk-payment-android", "title": "Headless SDK (Payment Android)", "content_markdown": "# Headless SDK (Payment Android)\n\n> 👍\n>\n> ### Recommended SDK\n>\n> For a smooth integration experience, we recommend using the [Android Seamless SDK](seamless-sdk-payment-android). This option provides a flexible payment solution with pre-built UI components and customization options.\n\nThis page provides a guide to the Yuno Headless Android SDK for payments.\n\nThis SDK is ideal for merchants who:\n\n* Need full control over the payment UI and user experience\n* Want to build custom payment flows\n* Require advanced integration capabilities\n\nThe Headless SDK includes core features like:\n\n* Direct API access for payment processing\n* Token generation for payment methods\n* 3DS authentication handling\n* Fraud prevention data collection\n\nFor merchants preferring a pre-built UI solution, consider using our [Full SDK](/docs/full-checkout-android) or [Lite SDK](/docs/lite-checkout-android) instead.\n\n## Requirements\n\nBefore starting the Yuno Android SDK integration, ensure your project meets the [technical requirements](/docs/requirements-android). Also, ensure the following prerequisites are in place:\n\n* You must have an active Yuno account.\n* You need your Yuno API credentials (`account_id`, `public-api-key`, and `private-secret-key`), which you can obtain from the [Developers section of the Yuno dashboard](../docs/developers-credentials). These credentials are required to authenticate requests to the Yuno API. The API is used to:\n  + Create a `customer`, which is required before initiating payments\n  + Create a `checkout_session`, which initializes the payment flow\n  + Create the payment associated with the session\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Latest SDK Version\n>\n> Check the [Release notes](release-notes-android-sdk) or visit the [Yuno Android SDK repository](https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-android) to verify the current SDK version available.\n\n## Step 1: Create a customer\n\nCreate a customer using the [Create customer endpoint](/reference/create-customer) before initiating payments. This step is required to:\n\n* Identify the person making the payment\n* Enable saved payment method functionality (if enabled)\n* Track payment history\n\nThe customer ID returned from this endpoint will be used when creating the `checkout_session`.\n\n## Step 2: Create a checkout session\n\nCreate a new `checkout_session` using the [Create checkout session](/reference/create-checkout-session) endpoint to initialize the payment flow. Make sure to:\n\n* Include the customer ID obtained from the previous step\n* Store the returned `checkout_session` ID for use in later steps\n\nThe `checkout_session` is unique for each payment attempt and cannot be reused.\n\n## Step 3: Include the library in your project\n\nInclude the Yuno SDK in your project through Gradle. Add the repository source:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nmaven { url \"https://yunopayments.jfrog.io/artifactory/snapshots-libs-release\" }\n```\n\nAdd the Yuno SDK dependency to your application in the `build.gradle` file:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'com.yuno.payments:android-sdk:{last_version}'\n}\n```\n\nYuno SDK includes, by default, the `INTERNET` permission, which is required to make network requests.\n\n`<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" />`\n\n## Step 4: Initialize headless SDK with the public key\n\nImport Yuno and provide a valid **PUBLIC\\_API\\_KEY** to initialize the Headless SDK. If you don't have your API credentials, see the [Developers (Credentials)](/docs/developers-credentials) page to check how to retrieve them from the dashboard.\n\nCreate a custom application if you haven't already. In the `onCreate()` method of your application class, initialize the SDK by calling the `Yuno.initialize()` function:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nclass CustomApplication : Application() {\n  override fun onCreate() {\n    super.onCreate()\n    Yuno.initialize(\n      this,\n      PUBLIC_API_KEY,\n      config: YunoConfig,\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Step 5: Start the checkout process\n\nCall the `apiClientPayment` function after your customer selects a payment method to start the checkout process. This function requires configuration parameters and initiates the collection of information needed for 3DS authentication and fraud prevention tools configured in your [routing](/docs/routing).\n\nThe following table describes the required parameters:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `country_code` | * This parameter determines the country for which the payment process is being configured. |\n|  | * The complete list of supported countries and their `country_code` is available on the [Country coverage](/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk) page. |\n| `checkout_session` | * Refers to the current payment's checkout session created using the [Create Checkout Session](/reference/create-checkout-session) endpoint. |\n|  | * `Example: '438413b7-4921-41e4-b8f3-28a5a0141638'` |\n\nThe following code block shows an example of the parameter configuration:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\n val apiClientPayment = Yuno.apiClientPayment(\n   country_code = \"US\",\n   checkoutSession = \"74bf4b96-6b35-42a6-8c73-2fe094c34ca9\",\n   context = this\n)\n```\n\n## Step 6: Generate token\n\nAfter collecting the user information, create a one-time token (OTT) using the `apiClientPayment.generateToken` function. Since this is an asynchronous function, use a `try/catch` block to handle any errors that may occur. The following examples show two different scenarios for creating a one-time token:\n\n1. **Example 1**: Create a one-time token using a card as the payment method and including all required card information.\n2. **Example 2**: Create a one-time token using the `vaulted_token` information.\n\n### Benefits of using a vaulted token\n\nWhen you use a vaulted token with the SDK, all the fraud information from the providers you configured in your card routing is collected and attached to the one-time token. You can also add installment information and a security code if the provider requires it.\n\nExample 1Example 2\n\n```\napiClientPayment.generateToken(\n   collectedData = TokenCollectedData(\n       checkoutSession = \"checkout_session\",\n       paymentMethod = PaymentMethod (\n           type = \"CARD\",\n           vaultedToken = null,\n           card = CardData(\n               save = true,\n               detail = Detail(\n                   expirationMonth = 11,\n                   expirationYear = 55,\n                   number = \"4111111111111111\",\n                   securityCode = \"123\",\n                   holderName = \"Firstname Lastname\",\n                   type = CardType.DEBIT\n               ),\n               installment = Installment(\n                   id = \"id\",\n                   value = 12\n               )\n           ),\n           customer = Customer(\n               id = \"id\",\n               merchantCustomerId = \"merchant_customer_id\",\n               firstName = \"firstName\",\n               lastName = \"lastName\",\n               gender = Gender.NB,\n               dateOfBirth = \"DD/MM/YYYY\",\n               email = \"[email protected]\",\n               country = \"US\",\n               document = Document(\n                   documentType = \"PAS\",\n                   documentNumber = \"PAS12312\"\n               ),\n               phone = Phone(\n                   number = \"321123321123\",\n                   country_code = \"1\"\n               )\n           )\n       )\n   ),\n   context = this\n)\n```\n\n```\napiClientPayment.generateToken(\n   collectedData = TokenCollectedData(\n       checkoutSession = \"checkout_session\",\n       paymentMethod = PaymentMethod(\n           type = \"CARD\",\n           vaultedToken = \"a1c7c5d1-b260-4dc6-909a-8368704233cf\",\n           card = CardData(\n               save = true,\n               detail = Detail(\n                   expirationMonth = 11,\n                   expirationYear = 55,\n                   number = \"4111111111111111\",\n                   securityCode = \"123\",\n                   holderName = \"Firstname Lastname\",\n                   type = CardType.DEBIT\n               ),\n               installment = Installment(\n                   id = \"id\",\n                   value = 12\n               )\n           ),\n           customer = Customer(\n               id = \"id\",\n               merchantCustomerId = \"merchant_customer_id\",\n               firstName = \"firstName\",\n               lastName = \"lastName\",\n               lastName = \"lastName\",\n               gender = Gender.NB,\n               dateOfBirth = \"DD/MM/YYYY\",\n               email = \"[email protected]\",\n               country = \"CO\",\n               document = Document(\n                   documentType = \"PAS\",\n                   documentNumber = \"PAS12312\"\n               ),\n               phone = Phone(\n                   number = \"321123321123\",\n                   countryCode = \"57\"\n               )\n           )\n       )\n   ),\n   context = this\n)\n```\n\nThe **apiClientPayment.generateToken** function returns an Observable type, which is a subclass of `LiveData`. You can observe the response as a common `LiveData` with the following type `SingleLiveEvent<Map<String, Any?>>`, which is a `LiveData` that only emits once. The response type is a `Map` containing the whole response. The following code block shows examples of responses after calling the `apiClientPayment.generateToken` function.\n\nExample 1Example 2\n\n```\n[\"token\": \"9ee44ac7-9134-4598-ae28-a26fec03099d\",\n     \"type\": \"CARD\",\n     \"customer\": [\"billing_address\": null,\n                  \"first_name\": null,\n                  \"gender\": \"\",\n                  \"phone\": nil,\n                  \"browser_info\": [\"color_depth\": null,\n                                   \"language\": \"en\",\n                                   \"accept_header\": \"*/*\",\n                                   \"browser_time_difference\": null,\n                                   \"accept_content\": null,\n                                   \"accept_browser\": null,\n                                   \"java_enabled\": null,\n                                   \"user_agent\": \"YunoSDK_Example/1 CFNetwork/1406.0.4 Darwin/22.6.0\",\n                                   \"screen_height\": \"844.0\",\n                                   \"screen_width\": \"390.0\",\n                                   \"javascript_enabled\": null],\n                  \"document\": null,\n                  \"last_name\": null,\n                  \"device_fingerprint\":null,\n                  \"email\": null],\n     \"country\": \"US\",\n     \"vaulted_token\": null,\n     \"installment\": [\"rate\": \"\",\n                     \"id\": \"cca80084-961b-4212-9c34-54f03f4f10ae\",\n                     \"value\": 24,\n                     \"amount\": null],\n     \"card_data\": null]\n```\n\n```\n[\"token\": \"9ee44ac7-9134-4598-ae28-a26fec03099d\",\n     \"type\": \"CARD\",\n     \"customer\": [\"billing_address\": null,\n                  \"first_name\": null,\n                  \"gender\": \"\",\n                  \"phone\": nil,\n                  \"browser_info\": [\"color_depth\": null,\n                                   \"language\": \"en\",\n                                   \"accept_header\": \"*/*\",\n                                   \"browser_time_difference\": null,\n                                   \"accept_content\": null,\n                                   \"accept_browser\": null,\n                                   \"java_enabled\": null,\n                                   \"user_agent\": \"YunoSDK_Example/1 CFNetwork/1406.0.4 Darwin/22.6.0\",\n                                   \"screen_height\": \"844.0\",\n                                   \"screen_width\": \"390.0\",\n                                   \"javascript_enabled\": null],\n                  \"document\": null,\n                  \"last_name\": null,\n                  \"device_fingerprint\":null,\n                  \"email\": null],\n     \"country\": \"BR\",\n     \"vaulted_token\":\"a1c7c5d1-b260-4dc6-909a-8368704233cf\",\n     \"installment\": [\"rate\": \"\",\n                     \"id\": \"cca80084-961b-4212-9c34-54f03f4f10ae\",\n                     \"value\": 24,\n                     \"amount\": null],\n     \"card_data\": null]\n```\n\nThe endpoint response provides the `sdk_action_required` parameter that defines if additional actions are necessary.\n\nThe following code block shows an example of observing the response:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\napiClientPayment.generateToken(data, context).observe(context) { response ->\n   val token = response[\"token\"] as String?\n   val error = response[\"error\"] as String?\n}\n```\n\n## Step 7: Create the payment\n\nAfter generating the one-time token, create the payment by calling the [Create Payment endpoint](/reference/create-payment). Include the one-time token obtained in [Step 6](/docs/headless-sdk-payment-android#step-6-generate-token) in the `payment_method.token` parameter of your request. The following code block shows an example of a payment creation request:\n\nJSON\n\n```\n{\n  \"merchant_order_id\": \"0000022\",\n  \"country\": \"US\",\n  \"account_id\": \"<Your account_id>\",\n  \"description\": \"Test\",\n  \"amount\": {\n    \"currency\": \"USD\",\n    \"value\": 500\n  },\n  \"customer_payer\": {\n    \"id\": \"cfae0941-7234-427a-a739-ef4fce966c79\"\n  },\n  \"checkout\": {\n    \"session\": \"<checkout session>\"\n  },\n  \"workflow\": \"SDK_CHECKOUT\",\n  \"payment_method\": {\n    \"type\":\"CARD\",\n    \"token\": \"2cd31999-e44e-4de3-bbe4-179981ff4295\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe endpoint response includes the `sdk_action_required` parameter that indicates whether additional actions are needed to complete the payment:\n\n* For synchronous payment methods, the payment completes instantly. In this case, `sdk_action_required` will be `false` in the API response and the payment process ends\n* For payment flows requiring additional SDK interaction, `sdk_action_required` will be `true`. When this happens, proceed to [Step 8](/docs/headless-sdk-payment-android#step-8-get-the-3ds-challenge-url) for next steps\n\n## Step 8: Get the 3DS challenge URL (if required)\n\nWhen a payment requires 3DS authentication, an additional challenge may be needed to verify the customer's identity. For more details about this process, see the [3D Secure](/docs/3d-secure) page. If a 3DS verification challenge is required, the Create Payment endpoint response will include the following:\n\n* A `THREE_D_SECURE` transaction type\n* Status equal to `PENDING` and sub status equal to `WAITING_ADDITIONAL_STEP`\n* `sdk_action_required = true`\n\nCall the `getThreeDSecureChallenge` function and provide the `checkoutSession` used to create the payment to get the 3DS challenge URL. After obtaining the URL, redirect your customer to complete the challenge. The following code block shows how to use the `getThreeDSecureChallenge` function:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nfun ApiClientPayment.getThreeDSecureChallenge(\n   context: Context,\n   checkoutSession: String? = null,\n): SingleLiveEvent<ThreeDSecureChallengeResponse>\n```\n\nThe `getThreeDSecureChallenge` function returns the `ThreeDSecureChallengeResponse` data class, described in the following code block:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\ndata class ThreeDSecureChallengeResponse(\n   val type: String,\n   val data: String,\n)\n```\n\nThe `type` can return `ERROR` or `URL`, defining if the function returned a valid URL for the challenge:\n\n* If `type = URL`, `data` will contain the URL your customer needs to access to complete the 3DS challenge.\n* If `type = ERROR`, `data` will contain the error message, informing the source of the problem.\n\nThe following code block shows an example of how you can observe the response from `ThreeDSecureChallengeResponse`:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\napiClientPayment.getThreeDSecureChallenge(this)?.observe(this) {\n   if (it.type == \"URL\") {\n   } else \n}\n```\n\nWhen the response type is \"URL\", you can load the 3DS challenge URL in your preferred view (WebView, Custom Tab, or browser). If the response type is not \"URL\", it indicates an error occurred and you should handle it appropriately by displaying an error message to the user.\n\nTo complete the 3DS challenge, redirect customers to the URL returned by `getThreeDSecureChallenge(context)`. After successful completion, customers are automatically redirected to the `callback_url` that you specified when creating the `checkout_session` using the [Create Checkout Session](/reference/create-checkout-session) endpoint. The following example shows how to load the 3DS challenge URL in a WebView:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nval webView = WebView(this)\nwebViewContainer.addView(\n   webView,\n   ConstraintLayout.LayoutParams(\n       ConstraintLayout.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT,\n       ConstraintLayout.LayoutParams.MATCH_PARENT\n   )\n)\nwebView.settings.javaScriptEnabled = true\nwebView.addJavascriptInterface(\n   object {\n       @JavascriptInterface\n       fun messageFromWeb(data: String?) {\n       }\n   },\n   \"Android\"\n)\nwebView.loadUrl(url)\n```\n\nThe JavaScript interface must use the name `messageFromWeb(data : String?)` and be added with the name `Android`. This allows you to capture challenge events and determine when they complete.\n\nTo complete the Headless SDK payment flow:\n\n1. Use [Yuno Webhooks](/docs/configure-webhooks) to receive notifications about:\n\n   * The outcome of the 3DS challenge\n   * The final payment status\n2. Optionally, retrieve payment details using the [Retrieve Payment by ID](/reference/retrieve-payment-by-id) endpoint.\n\nFor the complete payment implementation guide, see [Headless SDK (Payment)](/docs/headless-sdk-integration).\n\n## Complementary features\n\nYuno Android SDK provides additional services and configurations you can use to improve customers' experience. Use the [SDK customization](/docs/sdk-customizations-android) to change the SDK appearance to match your brand or to configure the loader.\n\n### Loader\n\nThe loader functionality is controlled through the `keepLoader` parameter in the `YunoConfig` data class, which is documented inline in the SDK configuration section above.\n\n### SDK customization\n\nYou can change the SDK appearance to match your brand.

SSO centralizes authentication, makes onboarding and offboarding team members easier, and ensures that only authorized users from your organization can access Yuno.\n\nYuno supports Single Sign-On (SSO) using the **SAML 2.0** (Security Assertion Markup Language) standard, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of identity providers that adhere to this protocol. We have successfully tested SSO integration with **Google**, **Microsoft**, **Okta**, and **Keycloak**. The dashboard is also designed to accommodate other SAML 2.0-compliant providers. Contact support for details on implementing additional providers.\n\n## Setting up SSO\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Admin Status Required\n>\n> To activate SSO, you must have the Admin role in all accounts within the organization.\n\n**Step 1: Access the security section**\n\n1. Log in to the Yuno dashboard as an administrator.\n2. Click your profile image and select **Security**. Go to the **Single sign-on** tab.\n\n[](https://github.com/writechoiceorg/yuno-images/raw/main/Insights/Video1.mov)\n\n**Step 2: Set up SSO**\n\nClick **Set up** to open the SSO configuration.\n\n1. Under **Identity provider**, select your desired option: **Google**, **Keycloack**, **Microsoft**, **Okta**, or **Other**.\n2. Copy the **Identifier (Entity ID)** and **Assertion consumer service URL** provided by Yuno.\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXd7Obd6lURxHjloLWCT2JSJB_mCS0N0g_53H8mhUkqTw7Nu3RNW_cAjekMBx0gAH1wDQbhJXzhmVJQqSnCoQkbkO37anutvQLOH1dNtgW_DJP-KoGUXk2Xn0YBq2v4V2Ciw9dSf7A?key=2dldRk3J4b42VwoUCEVS3Lpu)\n\n**Step 3: Configure the identity provider**\n\nNext, access the admin panel of your chosen identity provider. Here, you'll either generate a metadata XML file or obtain the necessary configuration details. Refer to your provider’s documentation for where to input Yuno’s information.\n\n1. Access your identity provider's admin panel.\n2. Paste the **Identifier (Entity ID)** and **Assertion Consumer Service URL** provided by Yuno into the relevant fields.\n3. Save the changes and generate the **XML metadata file**. Alternatively, you can save the Entity ID (IDP), Sign In URL, and Certificate.\n\n**Step 4: Finalize the configuration in Yuno**\n\nBack in the dashboard, you have two options to finish the SSO setup:\n\n* **Option A**: Upload the metadata XML from the identity provider.\n* **Option B**: Manually enter Entity ID (IDP), Sign In URL, and Certificate.\n\n[](https://github.com/writechoiceorg/yuno-images/raw/main/Insights/Video2.mov)\n\n**Managing SSO**\n\n* **Disable SSO**: Administrators can go to the **Login methods** tab of the Security section to toggle SSO on and off.\n* **View and edit configurations**: Admins may also modify the configuration in case of changes to the identity provider.

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/risk-conditions", "title": "Risk Conditions", "content_markdown": "# Risk Conditions\n\nYuno's **Risk conditions** empower merchants with advanced fraud prevention tools. This feature allows you to create and manage user lists and custom rules tailored to your business model, offering the flexibility to adapt protection strategies to your specific needs. Using the Risk conditions section reduces unnecessary requests to fraud prevention providers, optimizing resources and enhancing operational efficiency.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Go to the routing section to include your lists and rules in your routes\n>\n> Activate the Risk Conditions provider in the Connections section. Once the connection is established, add it to your routes, where you can then select the specific list(s) and/or rule(s) you want to use for each condition set.\n\nCurrently, the Risk conditions section provides three main tabs:\n\n* [Rules](#rules)\n* [Blocklists](#blocklists)\n* [Allowlists](#allowlists)\n\n## Rules\n\nYuno offers customizable velocity rules to help detect and respond to suspicious behaviour patterns, such as sudden surges in transaction volume over a short period. This proactive approach helps mitigate risks associated with stolen cards or compromised accounts exploited by cybercriminals.\n\nWith Yuno, you can create protection rules tailored to your specific business needs. These rules monitor transaction frequency and volume per individual account, allowing you to detect unusual activity in real time. You can select from multiple rule types and combine them to target specific fraudulent behaviours with precision.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Rule Example\n>\n> Block payments if the number of payments per user exceeds 5, with an amount greater than 50 USD per payment, within a 10-minute timeframe, at the account level in Colombia.\n\n[](https://github.com/writechoiceorg/yuno-images/raw/main/doc/yourPaymentsOperationSystem/routing-v2.mp4)\n\nIn addition to blocking fraudulent payments, Yuno's rules also help identify secure transactions. You can automatically bypass Fraud Screening or 3DS for verified payments to streamline the user experience. However, it's important to configure these rules carefully, as incorrect settings may lead to security gaps or unintended transaction blocks.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Remove Rules and Lists\n>\n> You can't delete allowlists, blocklists, or rules. Yuno uses this approach to ensure you'll have access to the history of affected payments. If you want to stop using a rule or a list, you only need to remove it from your routes.\n\nWithin the **Rules** tab, select **Create rule** to configure your own rules. Set the following parameters based on your needs:\n\n* **Name**: Give your rule a memorable name and description.\n* **Rule type**: Track the number of payments or cards used by a user within a specific timeframe. Add conditions to track shipping changes, IP addresses, card brands, metadata, and more.\n* **Settings**: Define the parameter used to count users, the types of payments to include (succeded, declined, etc.), and whether to count payments across the organization or the only current account.\n* **Outcome**: Choose to allow, block, review, or test payments when a rule is triggered.\n* **Apply this list to other accounts**: Choose whether to apply the rule to other accounts.\n\n## Blocklists\n\nBlocklists help prevent fraudulent activity by automatically declining payments from users that match specific parameters. You can manually add users to the list or upload a CSV file to block multiple users at once. It's also possible to configure an automatic removal period for each entry.\n\nA payment will be blocked if it matches any of the following:\n\n* Email\n* Phone number\n* Card BIN\n* IP address\n* Merchant customer ID\n* Card BIN + last 4 digits\n* Document number\n* Customer ID\n* Card/bank account holder name\n* Device ID\n* Shipping address\n* Metadata\n\nFrom the **Blocklists** tab, click **Create blocklist** to configure these parameters:\n\n1. **List name**: Enter a clear, descriptive name for the blocklist.\n2. **List type**: Select the parameter you want to block by (email, phone number, card BIN, device ID, etc.).\n3. **Add emails**: You can either:\n   * Enter individual values directly into the field (separated by commas or tabs), or\n   * Upload a CSV file containing a batch of entries.\n   * Optionally, enable the setting to **automatically remove entries** after a specified period of time.\n4. **Apply this list to other accounts**: Select which accounts the blocklist should apply to. By default, it only applies to the current account, but you can include other accounts by checking them from the list.\n\n## Allowlists\n\nAllowlists let you automatically approve transactions from trusted users based on matching parameters. This reduces friction and improves the experience for known, verified customers. You can add users manually or in bulk via CSV, and also configure automatic expiration for each entry.\n\nUsers can be allowlisted based on:\n\n* Email\n* Phone number\n* Card BIN\n* IP address\n* Merchant customer ID\n* Card BIN + Last 4 digits\n* Document number\n* Customer ID\n* Card/bank account holder name\n* Device ID\n* Shipping address\n* Metadata\n\nFrom the **Allowlists** tab, click **Create allowlist** to configure these parameters:\n\n1. **List name**: Enter a descriptive name for the allowlist.\n2. **List type**: Choose the parameter to match against, such as an email, card BIN, or device ID.\n3. **List outcome**: Select what happens when a match is found:\n   * Skip fraud screening\n   * Skip 3DS\n   * Skip both fraud screening and 3DS\n4. **Add emails**: Add addresses manually (separated by commas or tabs) or upload a CSV file.\n5. **Auto-remove**: Optionally enable automatic removal after a defined period of time.\n6. **Apply to accounts**: Choose which accounts the list should apply to. By default, it's limited to the current account, but you can apply it to others as needed.\n\n## Adding the Risk conditions connection\n\nYou must configure the **Risk conditions** connection to enable rules and lists. Follow these steps to set it up once you have created your rules and lists:\n\n1. Navigate to **Connections** in the dashboard, search for **Risk conditions**, and click **Connect**.\n2. Follow the simple on-screen instructions to add the Risk condition connection.\n3. Access **Routing** in the dashboard, select a route and add **Risk conditions** to it. From here, you can select which rules and lists to use for that payment method.\n4. Publish your route to activate the changes.\n\n[](https://github.com/writechoiceorg/yuno-images/raw/main/doc/yourPaymentsOperationSystem/risk_routing.mp4)\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Remove Rules and Blocklists\n>\n> You can't delete blocklists or rules.

[Learn more](#test)\n\n## Why use dynamic routing?\n\nYuno's user-friendly [dashboard](https://auth.y.uno/u/login?state=hKFo2SB1dGdwd0VYZWxrOHpaLVdWck5FYWYtaW5GN0hhM25MNaFur3VuaXZlcnNhbC1sb2dpbqN0aWTZIExidWxTMDRSNG5qYnZQQklTN3JtY0hyME5fZDBRa25xo2NpZNkgbGNIOEVyS3A3UUl2Tkx1Y0JUOXpEQlhrbXlaN25CSnc) offers a graphical interface to configure business rules for payments. Yuno's dynamic routing feature allows you to create personalized payment flows by defining validation and processing services according to your specific requirements. As a result, you can prioritize services that align with your needs, such as those with lower fees or higher approval rates.\n\nBy leveraging dynamic routing, you will enjoy several advantages:\n\n### Optimization\n\nYou can optimize your payment processing strategy in response to market changes, regulatory demands, or other factors. By quickly adjusting routing rules, you can seamlessly switch between PSPs or services, ensuring you will always use the best options for processing transactions.\n\n### Reduced costs\n\nDynamic routing allows you to significantly reduce payment processing fees. By routing transactions through the most cost-effective PSP or service, you can take advantage of lower fees or better exchange rates offered by different providers for specific currencies or transaction types.\n\n### Fraud mitigation\n\nYou can direct high-risk transactions to specialized fraud prevention providers or PSPs with advanced fraud detection capabilities, minimizing your exposure to fraudulent activities.\n\n### Increased processing speed\n\nDynamic routing ensures efficient and speedy transaction processing. Directing transactions to the most suitable PSP or service based on transaction volume, processing capacity, or response times can enhance the overall customer experience while reducing the likelihood of transaction failures or delays.\n\n## Configuring the dynamic routing\n\n1. First, access your [Yuno dashboard](https://auth.y.uno/u/login?state=hKFo2SB1dGdwd0VYZWxrOHpaLVdWck5FYWYtaW5GN0hhM25MNaFur3VuaXZlcnNhbC1sb2dpbqN0aWTZIExidWxTMDRSNG5qYnZQQklTN3JtY0hyME5fZDBRa25xo2NpZNkgbGNIOEVyS3A3UUl2Tkx1Y0JUOXpEQlhrbXlaN25CSnc) and go to **Routing**. The Routing section separates the payment methods by **published** and **Not published**. In the **Not published** tab, you will find the payment methods connected to your account that don’t have a published route.\n2. Choose a payment method and click on **Set up**. A panel will then appear, click on **Create new route** to start configuring routes.\n3. Name the route you will build and hit **Save**.\n4. Use the **Add new condition** button to define the condition that will trigger the payment processing route.\n5. Select and define one or more condition types to narrow the route usage. The conditions available vary depending on the selected payment method. Check a condition to see intuitive options for configuring each.\n6. Add connections to the condition created. Click the arrow next to your condition and then **Add step**. You will see a list of available connections including fraud solutions, processors, and acquirers, select one and click **Select**. If you select more than one connection, you will have to click **Next** and either determine the percentage of payments going through each, or select Smart Routing to handle the allocation automatically based on your preference.\n7. For each new connection, you can define paths for each possible case (**Succeeded**, **Declined**, and **Error**). New steps can be connected to each scenario to build a complete routing that meets your demands.\n8. After adding all steps of the payment process route, you can publish it using the **Publish** button, making it available for the respective payment method.\n\n[](https://github.com/writechoiceorg/yuno-images/raw/main/doc/yourPaymentsOperationSystem/routing_V3.mp4)\n\n## Smart Routing\n\nSmart Routing is a solution designed to intelligently optimize payment performance according to the variable you choose to optimize as a merchant. To activate Smart Routing, select two or more connections when setting conditions, click **Next**, and turn on the Smart Routing toggle.\n\nSmart Routing can optimize your payments in two ways:\n\n* **Conversion rate and latency**: Make intelligent decisions to optimize processing time while also achieving the highest conversion rate.\n* **Conversion rate and costs**: Make smart decisions to optimize costs while also achieving the highest conversion rate. Input the costs associated with each provider through the [Connections](../docs/connections) section. Smart Routing uses the costs you set up on the connection page to optimize your costs.\n\nYou only need to specify which providers you want to work with and which variable you want to optimize, and Smart Routing will route each payment through the optimal path.\n\nSmart routing can be applied automatically, optimizing payment distribution for you. Alternatively, manual control lets you define the exact percentage of transactions to route through each connection.\n\n[](https://github.com/writechoiceorg/yuno-images/raw/refs/heads/main/doc/yourPaymentsOperationSystem/smart-routing.mp4)\n\n## Post-authorization after Smart Routing\n\nYou can add a post-authorization provider after a Smart Routing step. This lets you run additional actions, such as risk reviews or settlements/captures, after approval. Add a new step and choose your desired provider (for example, Cybersource).\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/4f296625f1362d991f0b1ed518bc846a9a5cdfa61cca38e8c93845ef1cda9a5c-image.png)\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Connections](/docs/connections)[Monitors](/docs/monitors)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [What is dynamic routing?](#what-is-dynamic-routing)\n  + [Why use dynamic routing?](#why-use-dynamic-routing)\n  + - [Optimization](#optimization)\n    - [Reduced costs](#reduced-costs)\n    - [Fraud mitigation](#fraud-mitigation)\n    - [Increased processing speed](#increased-processing-speed)\n  + [Configuring the dynamic routing](#configuring-the-dynamic-routing)\n  + [Smart Routing](#smart-routing)\n  + [Post-authorization after Smart Routing](#post-authorization-after-smart-routing)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/4f296625f1362d991f0b1ed518bc846a9a5cdfa61cca38e8c93845ef1cda9a5c-image.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/4f296625f1362d991f0b1ed518bc846a9a5cdfa61cca38e8c93845ef1cda9a5c-image.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a diagram showing the different types of the user"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}
{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/set-up-payment-connection", "title": "Set Up Payment Connection", "content_markdown": "# Set Up Payment Connection\n\nBefore you can create payments using direct integration with Yuno's API, you must configure your account by setting up payment connections, defining payment routing, enabling payment methods, and obtaining your API credentials. This page explains these essential setup steps.\n\nYou'll learn how to:\n\n* Configure your first payment connection\n* Set up payment routing\n* Enable payment methods in the checkout builder\n* Get your API credentials, including your `public-api-key` and `private-secret-key`\n\n> > 📘\n> >\n> > ### Yuno Testing Gateway\n> >\n> > Make sure to choose the payment connection that suits your needs when following these instructions. If you want to test credit card payments, use [Yuno Testing Gateway](/docs/yuno-testing-gateway) as your provider.\n\n## Configure payment method\n\nBefore configuring a payment method, you first need to create a connection with one of the available providers.\n\n### Step 1: set up your connection\n\nTo set up your first payment connection:\n\n1. Navigate to **Connections** in the dashboard sidebar.\n2. Use the search bar to find the connection you need.\n3. Click **Connect** next to the gateway.\n4. Provide a descriptive name for the connection and follow any on-screen prompts.\n5. Click **Save**.\n\nA confirmation message will appear in the dashboard once your connection is successfully added.\n\n[](https://github.com/writechoiceorg/yuno-images/raw/main/doc/set_up_you_account/connection_setup_V4_v2.mp4)\n\n### Step 2: set up routing for your new connection\n\nPayment routing in Yuno allows you to define which connections will be used to process specific types of transactions. This enables dynamic routing logic and gives you flexibility to manage providers based on currency, country, or other factors. For a basic setup, follow these steps:\n\n1. Navigate to [Routing](https://dashboard.y.uno/routing) in the dashboard sidebar.\n2. Click on the **Not published** tab to view payment methods that have available connections but no configured routes.\n3. Find the desired payment method and click **Set Up**.\n4. In the pop-up window:\n   * Click **+ Create new route**.\n   * Enter a descriptive name for the route.\n   * Click **Save**.\n5. Click the arrow next to the new route and select **Add step**.\n6. Choose a **processor** from the list and click **Select**.\n7. Click **Publish** to save all your changes.\n\nYour new route now appears in the **Published** tab, indicating that the configured payment method will now process all transactions through this configured route.\n\n[](https://github.com/writechoiceorg/yuno-images/raw/main/doc/set_up_you_account/routing_V2.mp4)\n\n### Step 3: enable the payment method in the Checkout Builder\n\nAfter configuring your connection and routing, you need to enable the payment method to make it available in your checkout:\n\n1. Navigate to [Checkout Builder](https://dashboard.y.uno/checkout-builder) in the dashboard sidebar.\n2. Locate the configured payment method in the list of available methods.\n3. Toggle the switch to enable it.\n4. Click **Publish settings** to apply your changes.\n\n[](https://github.com/writechoiceorg/yuno-images/raw/main/doc/set_up_you_account/checkoutbuilder.mp4)\n\n### Step 4: get your API credentials\n\nTo complete the setup and integrate Yuno into your application, you will need to obtain your API credentials from the Yuno dashboard. These credentials are specific to the Sandbox environment:\n\n1. Navigate to the **Developers** section in the dashboard sidebar.\n2. In the Developer Tools section, locate your API credentials:\n   * **Public API Key**: Used for client-side SDK initialization.\n   * **Secret API Key**: Used for server-side API calls.\n\n[](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/writechoiceorg/yuno-images/main/doc/set_up_you_account/developer_V2.mp4)\n\nAfter you complete these steps, you're ready to create payments using **direct integration**.\n\nUpdated 5 months ago\n\n---\n\nWhat’s Next\n\n* [Create Payments](/docs/create-payment-basic)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Configure payment method](#configure-payment-method)\n  + - [Step 1: set up your connection](#step-1-set-up-your-connection)\n    - [Step 2: set up routing for your new connection](#step-2-set-up-routing-for-your-new-connection)\n    - [Step 3: enable the payment method in the Checkout Builder](#step-3-enable-the-payment-method-in-the-checkout-builder)\n    - [Step 4: get your API credentials](#step-4-get-your-api-credentials)", "images": [], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

This option provides a flexible payment solution with pre-built UI components and customization options.\n\nWelcome to the Yuno Full Web SDK guide. This guide will help you get started with Yuno's payment solutions. Whether you're looking to implement your first payment integration or enhance your existing setup, this guide provides all the information you need to create a seamless payment experience for your users.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Web SDK v1.3\n>\n> This guide covers Web SDK v1.3. To read about previous versions, explore the [related links](#related-links) or visit the [changelog](../changelog#/).\n\n## Choose your integration method\n\nLet's help you choose the integration method that best fits your needs. Each approach has specific advantages, and selecting the right one depends on your development environment, technical requirements, and preferences.\n\n* **[Method 1 (HTML)](#1-add-the-sdk-script-directly-in-html)**: Add a single script tag to your HTML file. This is the simplest method, ideal for basic implementations and quick prototypes\n* **[Method 2 (Dynamic JavaScript)](#2-inject-the-sdk-dynamically-using-javascript)**: Load the SDK programmatically with custom error handling and loading states. Best for applications needing more control over the integration\n* **[Method 3 (NPM)](#3-use-the-npm-module)**: Use our NPM package in modern JavaScript applications. This is our recommended approach, with dependency management, tree-shaking, and TypeScript support\n\n### 1. Add the SDK script directly in HTML\n\nThe simplest way to integrate the Yuno SDK is by adding a `<script>` tag to your HTML file. This method provides a quick implementation while maintaining proper asynchronous loading. The SDK exposes an event that notifies when it's fully loaded, ensuring you can safely initialize and use its features at the right time.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Important\n>\n> While the `defer` attribute ensures the script is executed after the HTML is parsed, it doesn't guarantee that the SDK script will always load last. In some cases, if the SDK loads faster than expected and the event listener is declared afterward, the `yuno-sdk-ready` event may have already fired — and your listener won't catch it. To prevent this, always define the listener before loading the SDK script.\n\nFirst, set up the event listener, then load the SDK:\n\nHTML\n\n```\n<script>\n  window.addEventListener('yuno-sdk-ready', () => {\n    console.log('SDK loaded');\n    const yuno = await Yuno.initialize(PUBLIC_API_KEY);\n  });\n</script>\n\n<script defer src=\"https://sdk-web.y.uno/v1.1/main.js\"></script>\n```\n\n### 2. Inject the SDK dynamically using JavaScript\n\nThe dynamic JavaScript injection method provides enhanced control over SDK loading and initialization. This approach enables you to:\n\n* Load the SDK programmatically when needed\n* Implement custom loading states and error handling\n* Precisely control when the SDK becomes available\n* Synchronize SDK initialization with your application logic\n* Create tailored error handling for your use case\n\nThis method is ideal when you need granular control over the SDK's loading process and want to handle various scenarios with precision.\n\nCreate a function to inject the SDK dynamically:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nexport const injectScript = async (): Promise<boolean> => {\n  const head = document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0];\n  const js = document.createElement('script');\n  js.src = \"https://sdk-web.y.uno/v1.1/main.js\";\n  js.defer = true;\n\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    window.addEventListener('yuno-sdk-ready', () => {\n      resolve(true);\n    });\n\n    js.onerror = (error) => {\n      const event = new CustomEvent('yuno-sdk-error', { detail: error });\n      window.dispatchEvent(event);\n      reject(new Error(`Failed to load script: ${js.src} - ${error.message}`));\n    };\n\n    head.appendChild(js);\n  });\n};\n```\n\nUse the function to inject the SDK:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nawait injectScript();\nconst yuno = await Yuno.initialize(PUBLIC_API_KEY);\n```\n\n### 3. Use the NPM module\n\nFor projects using NPM package management, you can install the SDK as a module through NPM. This approach provides better dependency management, version control, and seamless integration with modern JavaScript build tools and frameworks. It's particularly beneficial for applications using bundlers like webpack, Rollup, or Vite.\n\nBash\n\n```\nnpm install @yuno-payments/sdk-web\n```\n\nThen, load and initialize the SDK as follows:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nimport { loadScript } from '@yuno-payments/sdk-web';\n\nconst yuno = await loadScript();\nconst yuno = await Yuno.initialize(PUBLIC_API_KEY);\n```\n\n## Improve performance using `preconnect`\n\nTo optimize performance and reduce latency, we recommend adding `preconnect` links as early as possible within the `<head>` tag of your HTML document. These links allow browsers to quickly connect to our servers before resources are actually requested. This proactive approach can significantly improve loading times, especially for the initial SDK setup and subsequent API calls.\n\nHTML\n\n```\n<link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://sdk-web.y.uno\" />\n<link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://api.y.uno\" />\n<link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://sdk-web-card.prod.y.uno\" />\n```\n\n## Full SDK implementation\n\nAfter integrating the SDK using one of the methods described above, follow these steps to implement the full checkout functionality:\n\n[#### Full SDK implementation](../docs/full-sdk-implementation)\n\n## Stay Updated\n\nVisit the [changelog](/changelog) for the latest SDK updates and version history.\n\nUpdated about 1 month ago\n\n---\n\n[Seamless SDK (Payment Web)](/docs/seamless-sdk-payment-web)[Full SDK (Web) Implementation](/docs/full-sdk-implementation)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Choose your integration method](#choose-your-integration-method)\n  + - [1.

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/full-checkout-ios", "title": "Full SDK (iOS)", "content_markdown": "# Full SDK (iOS)\n\n> 👍\n>\n> ### Recommended SDK\n>\n> We recommend using the [iOS Seamless SDK](seamless-sdk-payment-ios) for a smooth integration experience. This option provides a flexible payment solution with pre-built UI components and customization options.\n\nThis page provides all the steps to add, configure, and use the Full iOS SDK in your project.\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo implement the Yuno iOS SDK, you need to meet the following requirements:\n\n* Add [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html) or [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/) to your project.\n* Use iOS version 14.0 or above.\n\n## Step 1: Include the library in your project\n\nYou can add the library using CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager.\n\n### CocoaPods\n\nTo add the Yuno SDK to your iOS project, you need to install the Yuno SDK. If you do not have a Podfile, follow the [CocoaPods guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html) to create one. After creating the Podfile, you will integrate the Yuno SDK with Cocoapods by adding the line below to your Podfile.\n\nRuby\n\n```\npod 'YunoSDK', '~> 1.1.22'\n```\n\nAfter, you need to run the installation:\n\nRuby\n\n```\npod install\n```\n\n### Swift Package Manager\n\nTo add the Yuno SDK to your iOS project, you need to install the [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/). With the Swift package set up, add `YunoSDK` as a dependency, as presented in the following code block:\n\nSwift\n\n```\ndependencies: [\n    .package(url: \"https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-ios.git\", .upToNextMajor(from: \"1.1.17\"))\n]\n```\n\n## Step 2: Initialize SDK with the public key\n\nTo start running the Yuno iOS Full checkout, first get your Yuno app ID and Public API Key. Then, import and initialize Yuno as shown below:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nimport YunoSDK\n\nYuno.initialize(\n    apiKey: \"PUBLIC_API_KEY\",\n    config: YunoConfig(),\n    callback: { (value: Bool) in }\n)\n```\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Credentials\n>\n> See the credentials page for more information: [https://docs.y.uno/reference/authentication](/reference/authentication)\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### UISceneDelegate Usage\n>\n> If your app is using a UISceneDelegate, ensure to place your Yuno initialization code within your SceneDelegate.\n\nThe Full checkout enables you to configure the appearance and process. This is an optional step that you configure through the class `YunoConfig`. If you want to set up the configurations, the following code block shows the elements that can be configured:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nfinal class YunoConfig {\n    let cardFormType: CardFormType,\n    let appearance: Yuno.Appearance,\n    let saveCardEnabled: Bool,\n    let keepLoader: Bool\n}\n```\n\nConfigure the SDK with the following options:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `cardFormType` | This field can be used to choose Payment and Enrollment Card flow. It's an optional property and considers `.oneStep` by default. |\n| `appearance` | This optional field defines the appearance of the checkout. By default, it uses Yuno styles. |\n| `saveCardEnabled` | This optional field can be used to choose if the **Save Card** checkbox is shown on card flows. It is false by default. |\n| `keepLoader` | This optional field provides control over when to hide the loader. If set to `true`, the `hideLoader()` function must be called to hide the loader. By default, it is set to `false`. |\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Access Your API Key\n>\n> Retrieve your API Key from the [Developers section](../docs/developers-credentials) in the Yuno Dashboard.\n\n## Step 3: Start the checkout process\n\nThe ViewController class is defined as a subclass of `UIViewController` and also adopts the `YunoPaymentDelegate` protocol.\n\n> ❗️\n>\n> ### Deprecation\n>\n> The `startCheckout` method has been deprecated in recent iOS SDK versions.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nprotocol YunoPaymentDelegate: AnyObject {\n\n    var checkoutSession: String { get }\n    var countryCode: String { get }\n    var language: String? { get }\n    var viewController: UIViewController? { get }\n\n    func yunoCreatePayment(with token: String)\n    func yunoCreatePayment(with token: String, information: [String: Any])\n    func yunoPaymentResult(_ result: Yuno.Result)\n}\n\n\nclass ViewController: YunoPaymentDelegate {\n\n    func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n    }\n}\n```\n\nParameters\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `checkoutSession` | Refers to the current payment's checkout session. |\n| `countryCode` | This parameter determines the country for which the payment process is being configured. The complete list of supported countries and their country code is available on the [Country coverage](/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk) page. |\n| `language` | Defines the language to be used in the payment forms. You can set it to one of the available language options:  * es (Spanish) * en (English) * pt (Portuguese) * fil (Filipino) * id (Indonesian) * ms (Malay) * th (Thai) * zh-TW (Chinese (Traditional, Taiwan)) * zh-CN (Chinese (Simplified, China)) * vi (Vietnamese) * fr (French) * pl (Polish) * it (Italian) * de (German) * ru (Russian) * tr (Turkish) * nl (Dutch) * sv (Swedish) * ko (Korean) * ja (Japanese) |\n| `viewController` | This property represents the `UIViewController` used to present the payment flow. Even though the property remains optional for backward compatibility, you must supply a visible controller so the SDK can present its UI correctly. |\n| `yunoCreatePayment(with token: String)` | This method is responsible for creating a payment with the provided token. It takes a String parameter called `token`, which represents the payment token. |\n| `yunoCreatePayment(with token: String, information: [String: Any])` | This method is responsible for creating a payment with the provided token. It takes a String parameter called `token`, representing the payment token. Additionally, it returns all the token response info in a dictionary. |\n| `yunoPaymentResult(_ result: Yuno.Result)` | This method is called when the payment process is completed, providing the result of the payment as a parameter of type `Yuno.Result`. |\n\n> ❗️\n>\n> ### Important Note on yunoCreatePayment\n>\n> You can call `yunoCreatePayment` with or without the `information` parameter based on your needs. However, use only one version in your code, as calling both is not required and may cause issues.\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Swift 6 Concurrency Requirements\n>\n> If you're using Swift 6, you'll need to implement the `YunoPaymentDelegate` protocol with specific concurrency considerations. Swift 6 introduces stricter thread safety requirements that affect how you implement delegates. See the [Implementing `YunoPaymentDelegate` with Swift 6 Concurrency](#implementing-yunopaymentdelegate-with-swift-6-concurrency) section for detailed implementation options and best practices.\n\n## Step 4: Add the SDK view to the checkout\n\nYour view needs to adopt the `YunoPaymentFullDelegate` protocol. This allows your app to respond to payment-related actions, such as when the user selects a payment method.\n\nHere is how to define the delegate:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nprotocol YunoPaymentFullDelegate: YunoPaymentDelegate {\n    func yunoDidSelect(paymentMethod: YunoSDK.PaymentMethodSelected)\n    func yunoDidUnenrollSuccessfully(_ success: Bool)\n    func yunoUpdatePaymentMethodsViewHeight(_ height: CGFloat)\n}\n```\n\nParameters\n\n| Function | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `yunoDidSelect(paymentMethod: YunoSDK.PaymentMethodSelected)` | Called when the user selects a payment method.  - `paymentMethod`: The method the user chose. |\n| `yunoDidUnenrollSuccessfully(_ success: Bool)` | Called when an unenroll action finishes.  - `success`: `true` if it worked, `false` if it didn't. |\n| `yunoUpdatePaymentMethodsViewHeight(_ height: CGFloat)` | Called when `getPaymentMethodViewAsync()` is invoked and whenever the view's height changes. |\n\nTo display the payment methods, call the following method and pass your view model or controller as the delegate.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nawait Yuno.getPaymentMethodViewAsync(delegate:)\n```\n\nThis method will automatically return the correct type of view depending on the UI framework you are using:\n\n* If you're using **UIKit**, it returns a `UIView`.\n* If you're using **SwiftUI**, it returns a `some View`.\n\nThis makes it easy to integrate the SDK into any iOS project, no matter which UI framework you use.\n\n## Step 5: Initiate the payment process\n\nTo start a payment after displaying the payment methods, call the `startPayment` method:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nYuno.startPayment(showPaymentStatus:Bool)\n```\n\n## Step 6: Get the OTT (one-time token)\n\nYou can obtain the one-time token to create the payment back-to-back at the end of this process. You will get the one-time token in the function `yunoCreatePayment()` that you implement when adopting the `YunoPaymentDelegate`. An example of retrieving the one-time token is shown below:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nfunc yunoCreatePayment(with token: String) { ... }\n```\n\n## Step 7: Create the Payment\n\nOnce you have completed the steps described above, you can create a payment. The back-to-back payment creation must be carried out using the [Create Payment endpoint](/reference/create-payment). The merchant should call their backend to create the payment within Yuno, using the one-time token and the checkout session.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Continue Payment Method\n>\n> To ensure a seamless payment experience, it's crucial to integrate the `continuePayment` method after creating a payment. This step is particularly important for asynchronous payment methods that require additional customer actions. Here's what you need to know:\n>\n> * **Asynchronous Payment Handling**: The API will signal the need for further action with the `sdk_action_required` field set to true.\n> * **Functionality**: The `yuno.continuePayment()` function is designed to manage and display any additional screens necessary for the customer to complete the payment.\n> * **Process Simplification**: By using this method, you can streamline the payment process, as it automatically handles various scenarios for you.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nYuno.continuePayment()\n```\n\n## Step 8: Handle Payment Status (Optional)\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Deep Links and Mercado Pago Checkout Pro\n>\n> This step is only required if you're using a payment method that relies on deep links or Mercado Pago Checkout Pro. If your payment methods don't use deep links, you can skip this step.\n\nSome payment methods take users out of your app to complete the transaction. Once the payment is finished, the user is redirected back to your app using a deep link. The SDK uses this deep link to check what happened, checking if the payment was successful, failed, or canceled, and can show a status screen to the user.\n\nTo handle this, you need to update your `AppDelegate` to pass the incoming URL back to the Yuno SDK. This lets the SDK read the result and optionally display the payment status. The following code snippet shows how you can add it to your app:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nfunc application(_ app: UIApplication,\n                 open url: URL,\n                 options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {\n\n  guard url.scheme == \"yunoexample\" else { return false }\n\n  return Yuno.receiveDeeplink(url)\n}\n```\n\nThis code listens for deep links that open your app. When a URL is received, it checks if the scheme matches the one you used in the `callback_url` during checkout session setup. If it matches, the URL is passed to the Yuno SDK using `Yuno.receiveDeeplink(...)`. The SDK then reads the payment result and shows the appropriate status screen to the user.\n\nMake sure the `url.scheme` in this code matches the `callback_url` you provided when creating the `checkout_session`.\n\n## Callback\n\nAfter the payment is completed, the SDK can return different transaction states: `success`, `fail`, `processing`, `reject`, `internalError`, and `userCancell`. The descriptions of each transaction state is presented in the table below.\n\n| Transaction state | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `succeeded` | Indicates that the transaction or payment process has been completed successfully. |\n| `fail` | This state indicates that the transaction or payment process has failed. It means that there was an error or issue during the payment process, preventing it from being completed successfully. |\n| `processing` | Indicates that the transaction or payment process is currently being processed. It is typically used when there is a delay in payment processing, such as waiting for approval from a third-party service or financial institution. |\n| `reject` | This state indicates that the transaction has been rejected. The rejection can occur for various reasons, such as insufficient funds, fraudulent activity, or requests that violate specific rules or policies. |\n| `internalError` | It means that an unexpected error occurred within the system or infrastructure handling the payment process. This state suggests a problem on the server or backend side rather than an issue with the user's input or request. |\n| `userCancell` | This state indicates that the user has voluntarily canceled or aborted the transaction or payment process. This state is typically used when there is an option for the user to cancel or abandon the payment process. |\n\nTo get the transaction state, you have to implement the delegate presented in the following piece of code:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nenum Result {\n    case reject, success, fail, processing, internalError, userCancell\n}\n\nfunc yunoPaymentResult(_ result: Yuno.Result) { ... }\nfunc yunoEnrollmentResult(_ result: Yuno.Result) { ... }\n```\n\n## Complementary Features\n\nYuno iOS SDK provides additional services and configurations you can use to improve customers' experience. Use the [SDK Customizations](../docs/sdk-customizations-ios) to change the SDK appearance to match your brand or to configure the loader.\n\n* **Loader**: Control the use of the loader through the SDK configuration options.\n* **Save card for future payments**: In addition, you can display a checkbox for save or enroll cards using `cardSaveEnable: true`. Below you can find examples of the checkbox for both card form renders.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/ae235ca04eda2c260442c375617e64950bed2a0564578771fcc3403de7ca965e-Card___save_for_future_payments.png)\n\n* You also can choose one of the render options for the card form. Below you find screenshots presenting the difference between the `cardFormType` `ONE_STEP` and `STEP_BY_STEP`.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/0a1e67430bc9765920c9252731b79626f3777c96322a66a760f682dafc72c637-Full_SDK_ios.png)\n\n* [SDK Customizations](../docs/sdk-customizations-ios): Change the SDK appearance to match your brand.\n\n### Click to Pay (CTP) with Passkey\n\nThe integration flow for Click to Pay Passkey requires specific handling of the response, which differs from the standard payment flow.\n\n#### Handling the One-Time Token (OTT) and Deeplink\n\nUnlike other processes, when a user completes a payment using CTP Passkey, the *One-Time Token* (`OTT`) will not be received through the usual delegate methods.\n\nInstead, the transaction result (successful or failed) will be communicated to your application via the **deeplink URL**.\n\n1. **Closing the External Browser**:\n\nWhen receiving the deeplink callback in your application, it is essential to immediately call the `receiveDeeplink` method:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nfunc application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {\n    \n    Yuno.receiveDeeplink(url: url)\n    \n    // Parse the URL to extract parameters\n    \n    return true\n}\n```\n\nCalling this method allows the SDK to properly close the external web browser that was used for Passkey authentication.\n\n2. **Processing the Deeplink URL**:\n\nThe deeplink URL will contain parameters in the query string that indicate the transaction status:\n\n* `has_error`: If this parameter is present, it indicates that an error occurred during the transaction. You should handle this error scenario.\n* `one_time_token`: If the transaction was successful, the URL will contain this token.\n\n3. **Creating the Payment**:\n\nIf you receive a `one_time_token` in the URL:\n\n1. Extract the value of the `one_time_token`.\n2. Use this token to create the payment using the [Create Payment endpoint](/reference/create-payment).\n3. Once the payment is created, proceed with the `continuePayment` flow in the SDK to finalize the transaction.\n\n> ⚠️\n>\n> ### Important\n>\n> The OTT will **not** be received through the `yunoCreatePayment(with token: String)` delegate method for CTP Passkey payments. You must extract the token from the deeplink URL parameters instead.\n\n### Render mode integration\n\nThe render mode in the Yuno SDK offers enhanced UI flexibility, enabling developers to integrate payment flows with complete control over the user interface while retaining full SDK functionality. This mode provides SwiftUI views that can be seamlessly incorporated into your existing UI.\n\n#### Main function: `startPaymentRenderFlow`\n\nThe `startPaymentRender` function is a feature of the Yuno SDK that allows merchants to integrate the payment process in a more detailed and customizable manner. This function grants full control over when and how payment forms are displayed, facilitating smoother integration with the merchant's existing application UI.\n\nThis function is designed to offer greater control over the payment flow, allowing merchants to:\n\n* Integrate payment forms in a customized manner within their own UI.\n* Precisely control when payment data forms are displayed.\n* Gain detailed control over the payment confirmation process.\n* Provide a more fluid and consistent user experience within the merchant's application.\n\n#### Syntax\n\nThe syntax section provides the method signature for the `startPaymentRender` function. This function is central to integrating the payment process within your application, offering a customizable and detailed approach to handling payment forms and flows.\n\nSwift\n\n```\n@MainActor static func startPaymentRenderFlow(\n    paymentMethodSelected: PaymentMethodSelected,\n    with delegate: YunoPaymentDelegate\n) async -> some YunoPaymentRenderFlowProtocol\n```\n\nParameters\n\nThe `startPaymentRender` function requires specific parameters to operate effectively. These parameters are essential for defining the payment method and handling the payment process responses.\n\n| Parameter | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `paymentMethodSelected` | `PaymentMethodSelected` | The payment method selected by the user. Must include the `vaultedToken` (if exists) and the `paymentMethodType` |\n| `delegate` | `YunoPaymentDelegate` | The delegate that will handle payment process responses, including token creation and final result |\n\n#### Return value\n\nReturns an instance that conforms to `YunoPaymentRenderFlowProtocol`, which provides methods to handle the payment rendering flow.\n\n#### YunoPaymentRenderFlowProtocol protocol\n\nThe instance returned by `startPaymentRender` conforms to this protocol which includes the following methods:\n\n#### formView(paymentMethodSelected:with:)\n\nSwift\n\n```\nfunc formView(\n    paymentMethodSelected: PaymentMethodSelected,\n    with delegate: YunoPaymentDelegate\n) async -> AnyView?\n```\n\n* **Purpose**: Gets the form view to capture payment data\n* **Behavior**:\n  + If the payment method requires showing a form, returns an `AnyView` with the corresponding form\n  + If the payment method doesn't need to show any form (e.g., already configured methods), returns `nil`\n* **When to use**: Call immediately after creating the payment flow instance\n\n#### submitForm()\n\nSwift\n\n```\nfunc submitForm()\n```\n\n* **Purpose**: Submits form data for validation\n* **Behavior**: Executes all necessary validations and, if successful, proceeds to generate a new one-time token\n* **When to use**: When the user executes the \"pay\" action in the merchant's application\n\n#### continuePayment()\n\nSwift\n\n```\nfunc continuePayment() async -> AnyView?\n```\n\n* **Purpose**: Continues the payment process after the one-time token has been generated\n* **Behavior**:\n  + If it's necessary to show any additional view (e.g., 3DS authentication), returns an `AnyView`\n  + If no additional view is required, returns `nil`\n* **When to use**: After receiving the one-time token through the delegate and creating the payment\n\n#### Implementation flow\n\nThis section outlines the sequence of steps required to implement the payment rendering process using the Yuno SDK.\n\n**Step 1: Initial setup**\n\nTo begin using `startPaymentRender`, make sure the SDK is properly initialized and you possess a valid `checkoutSession`. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nawait Yuno.initialize(apiKey: \"your_api_key\")\n```\n\n**Step 2: Create payment flow instance**\n\nCreate a payment flow instance to manage and render the payment process using the selected method.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nlet paymentFlow = await Yuno.startPaymentRenderFlow(\n    paymentMethodSelected: selectedPaymentMethod,\n    with: self\n)\n```\n\n**Step 3: Get and display the form**\n\nRetrieve and present the payment form to collect user payment information efficiently.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nlet formView = await paymentFlow.formView(\n    paymentMethodSelected: selectedPaymentMethod,\n    with: self\n)\n\nif let formView = formView {\n    VStack {\n        Text(\"Payment Information\")\n\n        formView\n\n        Button(\"Pay\") {\n            paymentFlow.submitForm()\n        }\n    }\n} else {\n    paymentFlow.submitForm()\n}\n```\n\n**Step 4: Handle the one time token**\n\nImplement the delegate method to receive the token:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nextension MyViewController: YunoPaymentDelegate {\n    var checkoutSession: String {\n        return \"your_checkout_session\"\n    }\n\n    var countryCode: String {\n        return \"CO\"\n    }\n\n    var viewController: UIViewController? {\n        return self\n    }\n\n    func yunoCreatePayment(with token: String, information: [String: Any]) {\n        createPaymentInBackend(token: token) { [weak self] success in\n            if success {\n                Task {\n                    let additionalView = await self?.paymentFlow?.continuePayment()\n                    if let additionalView = additionalView {\n                        self?.showAdditionalView(additionalView)\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    func yunoPaymentResult(_ result: Yuno.Result) {\n        switch result {\n        case .succeeded:\n            showSuccessMessage()\n        case .reject:\n            showRejectionMessage()\n        case .fail:\n            showErrorMessage()\n        case .processing:\n            showProcessingMessage()\n        case .userCancell:\n            handleCancellation()\n        case .internalError:\n            showInternalErrorMessage()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Complete example\n\nSwift\n\n```\nimport SwiftUI\nimport YunoSDK\n\nstruct PaymentRenderView: View {\n    @State private var paymentFlow: YunoPaymentRenderFlowProtocol?\n    @State private var formView: AnyView?\n    @State private var additionalView: AnyView?\n\n    let selectedPaymentMethod: PaymentMethodSelected\n    let delegate: YunoPaymentDelegate\n\n    var body: some View {\n        VStack(spacing: 20) {\n            Text(\"Complete Purchase\")\n                .font(.title2)\n                .fontWeight(.bold)\n\n            OrderSummaryView()\n\n            if let formView = formView {\n                VStack(alignment: .leading) {\n                    Text(\"Payment Information\")\n                        .font(.headline)\n\n                    formView\n                }\n            }\n\n            if let additionalView = additionalView {\n                additionalView\n            }\n\n            Spacer()\n\n            Button(action: {\n                paymentFlow?.submitForm()\n            }) {\n                Text(\"Confirm Payment\")\n                    .font(.headline)\n                    .foregroundColor(.white)\n                    .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)\n                    .padding()\n                    .background(Color.blue)\n                    .cornerRadius(10)\n            }\n        }\n        .padding()\n        .onAppear {\n            setupPaymentFlow()\n        }\n    }\n\n    private func setupPaymentFlow() {\npaymentFlow = await Yuno.startPaymentRenderFlow(\n    paymentMethodSelected: selectedPaymentMethod,\n    with: delegate\n)\n\n        Task {\n            formView = await paymentFlow?.formView(\n                paymentMethodSelected: selectedPaymentMethod,\n                with: delegate\n            )\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nclass PaymentDelegate: YunoPaymentDelegate {\n    let checkoutSession: String\n    let countryCode: String\n    weak var viewController: UIViewController?\n\n    init(checkoutSession: String, countryCode: String, viewController: UIViewController?) {\n        self.checkoutSession = checkoutSession\n        self.countryCode = countryCode\n        self.viewController = viewController\n    }\n\n    func yunoCreatePayment(with token: String, information: [String: Any]) {\n        PaymentService.createPayment(token: token) { [weak self] result in\n            switch result {\n            case .success:\n                Task {\n                    await self?.continuePaymentProcess()\n                }\n            case .failure(let error):\n                print(\"Error creating payment: \\(error)\")\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    func yunoPaymentResult(_ result: Yuno.Result) {\n        DispatchQueue.main.async {\n            switch result {\n            case .succeeded:\n                NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .paymentSucceeded, object: nil)\n            case .reject:\n                NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .paymentRejected, object: nil)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    private func continuePaymentProcess() async {\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Common use cases\n\nThis section outlines typical scenarios where the Yuno SDK can be utilized to handle various payment methods, providing flexibility and ease of integration.\n\n#### 1. Credit card payment\n\nIn this use case, we demonstrate how to process payments using new credit card information, requiring the user to fill out a form to capture the necessary card details.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nlet cardPayment = CardPaymentMethod(paymentMethodType: \"CARD\")\nlet flow = Yuno.startPaymentRender(paymentMethodSelected: cardPayment, with: delegate)\n\nlet form = await flow.formView(paymentMethodSelected: cardPayment, with: delegate)\n```\n\n#### 2. Payment with saved method\n\nThis scenario demonstrates using a saved payment method, allowing users to pay without re-entering details by utilizing a vaulted token.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nlet savedCard = SavedCardPayment(\n    paymentMethodType: \"CARD\",\n    vaultedToken: \"saved_token_123\"\n)\nlet flow = Yuno.startPaymentRender(paymentMethodSelected: savedCard, with: delegate)\n\nlet form = await flow.formView(paymentMethodSelected: savedCard, with: delegate)\n```\n\n#### 3. Payment with 3DS authentication\n\n3D Secure (3DS) adds an extra verification step for enhanced security. The Yuno SDK integrates this process into your payment flow seamlessly.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nfunc yunoCreatePayment(with token: String, information: [String: Any]) {\n    createPayment(token: token) { [weak self] success in\n        if success {\n            Task {\n                let authView = await self?.paymentFlow?.continuePayment()\n                if let authView = authView {\n                    self?.show3DSView(authView)\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Important considerations\n\nThis section highlights key points for integrating the Yuno SDK effectively, ensuring a seamless and secure payment process.\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\n* Ensure the SDK is initialized before using `startPaymentRender`\n* The delegate must implement all required methods of `YunoPaymentDelegate`\n* The `checkoutSession` must be valid and active\n\n#### State management\n\n* Always check if `formView()` returns `nil` before displaying the view\n* Properly handle the case where `continuePayment()` returns `nil`\n* Implement loading states during asynchronous operations\n\n#### Security\n\n* Never store one-time tokens - use them immediately\n* Always validate payment results in your backend\n* Implement appropriate timeouts for network operations\n\n#### Performance\n\n* Calls to `formView()` and `continuePayment()` are asynchronous\n* Consider showing loading indicators during these operations\n* Reuse the payment flow instance when possible\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nThis section offers quick solutions to common issues encountered during Yuno SDK integration, ensuring a smoother payment process.\n\n#### Common issues\n\n1. **`formView()`always returns`nil`**\n\n   * Verify that the selected payment method requires a form\n   * Ensure the SDK is initialized correctly\n2. **Delegate doesn't receive`yunoCreatePayment`**\n\n   * Verify that `submitForm()` is being called correctly\n   * Confirm that the form has valid data\n3. **`continuePayment()`doesn't return view when expected**\n\n   * Some payment methods don't require additional views\n   * Check the payment method configuration in your Yuno dashboard\n\n#### Debugging logs\n\nSwift\n\n```\nYuno.config.environment = .staging\n```\n\n### Migration from other methods\n\nIf you're migrating from `startPayment()` or `startPaymentLite()`:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nYuno.startPayment(showPaymentStatus: true)\n\nlet flow = Yuno.startPaymentRender(paymentMethodSelected: method, with: delegate)\nlet form = await flow.formView(paymentMethodSelected: method, with: delegate)\n```\n\nThe primary benefit of using the new method is the detailed control it provides over both the user interface and the payment process.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Demo App\n>\n> In addition to the code examples provided, you can access the [Yuno repository](https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-ios) for a complete implementation of Yuno iOS SDKs.\n\n## Implementing `YunoPaymentDelegate` with Swift 6 Concurrency\n\nSwift 6 introduces stricter concurrency requirements that affect how you implement the `YunoPaymentDelegate` protocol. This section explains the challenges and provides solutions for different implementation scenarios.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Understanding Concurrency in Swift 6\n>\n> Concurrency is the ability of your app to manage multiple tasks simultaneously. With Swift 6, concurrency rules have become more stringent to enhance app stability and prevent crashes. This means that your code must be more carefully structured to ensure thread safety and proper task management.\n\n### The problem\n\nWith Swift 6, protocols that inherit from `Sendable` require all their implementations to be thread-safe. This generates warnings when implementing the delegate in classes marked as `@MainActor`.\n\nThread-safe means your code can be safely called from multiple threads without causing crashes or unexpected behavior. `@MainActor` ensures code runs on the main thread (UI thread).\n\n### Our design decision\n\nWe do not mark protocols as `@MainActor` because:\n\n* It would force all implementations to be `MainActor`-compatible\n* It would reduce flexibility for merchants who don't use `MainActor`\n* Each implementation has different concurrency needs\n\n### Merchant's responsibility\n\nIt's the merchant's responsibility to handle concurrency according to their implementation. Below are three different approaches you can use depending on your specific needs.\n\n#### Option 1: Immutable properties\n\nThis approach uses immutable properties that are automatically thread-safe, making them ideal for simple configurations. It is best suited for simple apps with fixed configuration values that don't change during runtime.\n\nSwift\n\n```\n@MainActor\nclass MyViewController: UIViewController, YunoPaymentDelegate {\n\n    private let _countryCode = \"CO\"\n    private let _language = \"EN\"\n\n    nonisolated var countryCode: String { _countryCode }\n    nonisolated var language: String? { _language }\n    nonisolated var checkoutSession: String { _checkoutSession }\n\n    nonisolated func yunoPaymentResult(_ result: Yuno.Result) {\n        Task { @MainActor in\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Option 2: Mutable properties with `MainActor.assumeIsolated`\n\nThis approach, best for apps where configuration values might change during runtime (like user preferences), allows for mutable properties while maintaining thread safety by using `MainActor.assumeIsolated`.\n\nSwift\n\n```\n@MainActor\nclass MyViewController: UIViewController, YunoPaymentDelegate {\n\n    @Published var configLanguage: String = \"EN\"\n    @Published var configCountryCode: String = \"CO\"\n\n    nonisolated var language: String? {\n        MainActor.assumeIsolated { configLanguage }\n    }\n\n    nonisolated var countryCode: String {\n        MainActor.assumeIsolated { configCountryCode }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Option 3: For non-`MainActor` classes\n\nThis approach is suitable for service classes that don't require `MainActor` isolation, making it best for background services or utility classes that don't interact with the UI.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nclass MyService: YunoPaymentDelegate {\n\n    let countryCode: String\n    let language: String?\n    let checkoutSession: String\n    let viewController: UIViewController?\n\n    init(countryCode: String, language: String?, checkoutSession: String, viewController: UIViewController?) {\n        self.countryCode = countryCode\n        self.language = language\n        self.checkoutSession = checkoutSession\n        self.viewController = viewController\n    }\n\n    func yunoPaymentResult(_ result: Yuno.Result) {\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### ⚠️ Important considerations\n\nWhen implementing concurrency in your delegate, keep these key points in mind:\n\n* `MainActor.assumeIsolated`: Only use when you guarantee it's called from `MainActor`. This is a safety mechanism that tells Swift \"trust me, I know this is running on the main thread.\"\n* `nonisolated`: Means it can be accessed from any thread, so it must be thread-safe. Use this when your properties or methods don't depend on UI state.\n* `viewController`: Remains as `@MainActor` because it should always be accessed from the main thread.

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/apple-pay-sdk-integration", "title": "SDK Integration", "content_markdown": "# SDK Integration\n\nThis guide provides a comprehensive process to integrate Apple Pay with Yuno SDK for both one-time and recurring payments. The SDK simplifies Apple Pay integration by handling payment token management and providing built-in security.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Setup Required\n>\n> Before implementing Apple Pay payments, ensure you have completed the [prerequisites](/docs/prerequisites-apple-pay).\n\n## Apple Pay overview\n\n1. Customer initiates payment on their iOS device\n2. Receive `payment_token` via Apple SDK\n3. Create a checkout session with Yuno\n4. Yuno processes with your configured provider(s) and returns a response\n5. Monitor response status via webhooks\n\n## Add Apple Pay capability\n\nTo add Apple Pay capability to your iOS app:\n\n1. In Xcode, select your project in the navigator\n2. Select your app target\n3. Go to the **Signing & Capabilities** tab\n4. Click **+ Capability** and search for \"Apple Pay\"\n5. Add the **Apple Pay** capability\n6. Configure your Merchant IDs in the Apple Pay section\n\n> ⚠️\n>\n> Ensure your Apple Pay Merchant ID matches the one configured in your Yuno Dashboard provider connections.\n\n## One-time payments with SDK\n\nOne-time Apple Pay payments using the Yuno SDK provide a streamlined integration experience for immediate transactions.\n\n### Create checkout session\n\nUse the [create checkout session](/reference/create-checkout-session) endpoint to create a payment session for one-time Apple Pay transactions:\n\nJSON\n\n```\n{\n  \"country\": \"US\",\n  \"customer_id\": \"070a34cb-4649-4a4e-b231-065a53060379\",\n  \"merchant_order_id\": \"order-123\",\n  \"payment_description\": \"Apple Pay one-time payment\",\n  \"amount\": {\n    \"currency\": \"USD\",\n    \"value\": 100\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Process the payment\n\nThe SDK handles the Apple Pay flow automatically. When the customer completes the Apple Pay authorization, the payment is processed immediately.\n\n## Recurring payments with SDK\n\nThe SDK streamlines recurring payments by managing both Customer‑Initiated (CIT) and Merchant‑Initiated (MIT) transactions while securely handling payment tokens.\n\n### Customer Initiated Transaction (CIT)\n\nThe CIT is the initial transaction where the customer authorizes recurring payments, such as when they subscribe to a monthly service. This transaction requires customer interaction and generates a token for future MIT transactions.\n\n#### Example CIT request\n\nJSON\n\n```\n{\n  \"account_id\": \"62fa3145-1408-4044-a599-caa0c2159782\",\n  \"amount\": {\n    \"currency\": \"USD\",\n    \"value\": 2000\n  },\n  \"checkout\": {\n    \"session\": \"0793c7a5-79c6-40d6-aa5f-13e4e9bdf169\"\n  },\n  \"payment_method\": {\n    \"vault_on_success\": true,\n    \"detail\": {\n      \"wallet\": {\n        \"payment_token\": \"{\\n  \\\"paymentMethod\\\": {\\n    \\\"type\\\": \\\"credit\\\",\\n    \\\"displayName\\\": \\\"Visa 3748\\\",\\n    \\\"network\\\": \\\"Visa\\\"\\n  },\\n  \\\"paymentData\\\": {\\n    \\\"data\\\": \\\"B5NSQI0TdXuLwqadBCL0yOwtik/rJx7v41xxE8rNSlFBTHR2W88iRck7a6bH9Kx/bBFsk2ZyinIEl2aXusHp22a0pSmuCUoPgbkFc1/D3PRAoWITfZkalBeuzMhHJGhhCe2wqOgMmjS2w97nN9vifb1cMrS3kOqpPPMihHVvhLYbwtNhh8lfeTOyL+RBXbdFScVTFCB1eFQ4znUFV79SHVK/SRjLxLawO1HGIO0VIUTj8uVgG4MmBrfQhDBD/P9a4lWypiNoyURHm7ubgcOEelbVDGlKSNDmYFD10i554b+7z8GXBtWdQc1zhWKcGOn8RsOYtxxdqzHEtJzcFsf92/rEhfpEThXjsLLMTmovGyQS30qM/qO2YgqduEID7IS+xOH/FXpplT5Yqur7/+FgEwcv2lGsa0K6kNMEUn1xSWc=\\\",\\n    \\\"signature\\\": \\\"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 TCCA 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\\\",\\n    \\\"header\\\": {\\n      \\\"publicKeyHash\\\": \\\"YK8kdoBXLGqBQKBtCZOl0DQTUHOWidRCxgOgf/1gBMM=\\\",\\n      \\\"ephemeralPublicKey\\\": \\\"MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEEVv32VVJYlg+E0zMsthvBaldJcH45NUWhVckme/CQYFtHf60FEdFtzwabOEMY3u1De+6e+IuBv53OxmWx+1w2w==\\\",\\n      \\\"transactionId\\\": \\\"87a03c4cc1b242a25d74257d4bc990a6473b9866392850e584a9f680dcdf3d0f\\\"\\n    },\\n    \\\"version\\\": \\\"EC_v1\\\"\\n  }\\n}\",\n        \"stored_credentials\": {\n          \"reason\": \"SUBSCRIPTION\",\n          \"usage\": \"FIRST\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"type\": \"APPLE_PAY\"\n  },\n  \"customer_payer\": {\n    \"id\": \"070a34cb-4649-4a4e-b231-065a53060379\",\n    \"nationality\": \"CO\",\n    \"browser_info\": {\n      \"user_agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh;

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/qr-and-instant-pay", "title": "QR code & Instant Payment", "content_markdown": "# QR code & Instant Payment\n\nIn the **QR Code & Instant Payment** journey, Yuno presents a single QR code that both charges the customer immediately and enrolls them for all future recurring payments in one seamless step. When the customer scans the QR, their banking app processes the first installment and simultaneously captures their consent for subsequent automated charges, removing the need for any additional approvals or manual input.\n\nAfter the initial scan and payment, each **subsequent request** is send by the merchant via Yuno and validated automatically by the customer’s bank against the original consent, ensuring fast, reliable transfers without further customer interaction. This flow maximizes conversion and simplifies subscription management by combining enrollment and payment into a single user action.\n\n## Step 1: First payment and subscription creation\n\nTo initiate the flow, you must start with a standard [Pix payment](/reference/create-payment#/) that also sets up the subscription. This generates a QR code or redirect screen for the customer to authorize the recurrence. Once paid, the subscription is created and a `subscription_id` is returned.\n\nYou can define the frequency, availability window, and the amount type (fixed or variable) as part of the subscription payload.\n\n| Fields for subscriptions | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Frequency | Define the frequency at which subscription charges will occur, whether daily, weekly, or monthly, specifying the amount that needs to be charged for the next billing cycle. |\n| Availability | The start and end dates of the subscription. |\n| Amount | Define the value you will use for future payments of the subscription. Could be `FIXED` with a minimum value defined, or `VARIABLE` without an amount defined for future payments. |\n\nAs [mentioned before](/reference/pix-automático-overview), have in mind that the information defined in the subscription creation will restrict the dates and values to be used for future payments.\n\nExample\n\n```\n{\n  \"amount\": {\n    \"value\": \"100\",\n    \"currency\": \"BRL\"\n  },\n\t\"payment_method\": {\n        \"type\": \"PIX_AUTOMATIC\"\n\t},\n\t\"subscription\": {\n    \"frequency\": {\n      \"type\": \"MONTH\",\n      \"value\": 1\n    },\n    \"availability\": {\n      \"start_at\": \"2025-05-23T20:17:30.277678Z\",\n      \"finish_at\": \"2027-05-23T20:17:30.277678Z\"\n    },\n    \"amount\": {\n      \"value\": \"100\",\n      \"currency\": \"BRL\",\n      \"type\": \"FIXED\" // or \"VARIABLE\"\n    }\n  }\n```\n\nAfter the initial payment is confirmed, the customer has an active subscription, and you can begin scheduling future charges.\n\n## Step 2: Future payments\n\nAs defined by the central bank, payments must be created at most **2 days before the scheduled billing date and at least 10 days** after the subscription was created. Use the subscription\\_id to identify the recurrence in the [payment creation](/reference/create-payment#/).\n\n| Fields for future payments |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| `subscription_id` | ID of the subscription obtained in the first step. |\n| billing\\_date | By specifying the billing\\_date object, the merchant can define the logic behind the exact date for the billing of the subscription. |\n\nExample\n\n```\n\"workflow\": \"DIRECT\",\n\"amount\": {\n  \"value\": \"100\",\n  \"currency\": \"BRL\"\n},\n\"payment_method\": {\n  \"type\": \"PIX_AUTOMATIC\",\n},\n\"subscription\": {\n  \"id\": \"cab9f0fe-2428-419b-8f9d-4b5efee8c1c8\",\n  \"billing_date\": {\n    \"type\": \"DAY\",\n    \"day\": 14\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf a recurring payment fails, it can be retried using a new payment request. **Retries** must occur **within 7 days** of the original billing date and are limited to **3 attempts per cycle**.\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Enviroments](/docs/enviroments)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Step 1: First payment and subscription creation](#step-1-first-payment-and-subscription-creation)\n  + [Step 2: Future payments](#step-2-future-payments)", "images": [], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/card-account-updater", "title": "Card Account Updater", "content_markdown": "# Card Account Updater\n\nCard Account Updater (CAU) is a feature available at Yuno to maintain the integrity of stored credit or debit cards, preventing issues caused by expired or outdated card details. When customers provide their card information for recurring billing or subscription services, Card Account Updater ensures that their stored card data remains current. With Yuno’s Card Account Updater, no additional development effort is required to ensure your card details will be updated seamlessly in the background.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/56a99306e4991180fe968be6ef7c34c035ede94ec07f623a12d3a24edbdeea46-YunoCardAccount_Updater.png)\n\n## Benefits of Card Account Updater\n\n* **Improved Payment Success Rates:** Automatically updating card information reduces the likelihood of failed transactions due to expired or replaced cards, ensuring a higher success rate for recurring payments.\n* **Enhanced Customer Experience:** By ensuring seamless and uninterrupted service, customers do not need to manually update their card information, leading to a smoother and more positive experience.\n* **Reduced Operational Costs:** Automated updates decrease the need for manual interventions and customer service inquiries related to payment issues, saving time and resources.\n* **Increased Revenue:** Higher transaction approval rates translate to fewer missed payments and potentially increased revenue.\n* **Security and Compliance:** Centralizing card updates within the vault ensures that sensitive card information is handled securely and complies with relevant regulations and standards.\n* **Operational Efficiency:** Streamlining the process of updating card information helps maintain operational efficiency and consistency across payment systems.\n* **Customer Retention:** Minimizing disruptions in service due to payment failures can help maintain customer loyalty and retention.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nThe Card Account Updater service operates asynchronously, working independently of the payment flow. Card updates are performed automatically, so there is no need to handle individual responses from the service.\n\nYuno updates card details in the following scenarios:\n\n* The card is past its expiration date.\n* The account associated with the card is in a closed, disabled, or flagged state.\n\nWhen the card's expiration date has passed, Yuno can update all the card information or only the expiration date. The option used will depend on the card issuer's approach to card replacement.\n\nOnce a card has been updated, Yuno will send a webhook to notify you of the change. **The`vaulted_token` and `fingerprint` for the enrolled card will remain the same, so you don't need to change anything in your integration**. This webhook will contain the following:\n\n* The latest expiry date, last four digits, and Issuer Identification Number (IIN).\n* The reason for the update.\n* Details of the card being replaced.\n\nThe following code block presents a notification example:\n\nJSON\n\n```\n{\n  \"type\": \"enrollment\",\n  \"type_event\": \"enrollment.update\",\n  \"account_id\": \"493e9374-510a-4201-9e09-de669d75f256\",\n  \"retry\": 0,\n  \"version\": 2,\n  \"data\": {\n    \"payment_method\": {\n      \"id\": \"03c3aae1-ed42-4be6-bc24-de5487f58491\",\n      \"account_id\": \"493e9374-510a-4201-9e09-de669d75f256\",\n      \"name\": \"VISA ****1111\",\n      \"description\": \"VISA ****1111\",\n      \"type\": \"CARD\",\n      \"category\": \"CARD\",\n      \"country\": \"CO\",\n      \"status\": \"ENROLLED\",\n      \"customer_id\": \"2f38972e-2427-43b7-95be-ee4cf21cef1b\",\n      \"created_at\": \"2024-09-10T15:04:10.453741Z\",\n      \"updated_at\": \"2024-09-10T15:04:10.453745Z\",\n      \"enrollment\": {\n        \"session\": null,\n        \"sdk_action_required\": false\n      },\n      \"verify\": {\n        \"vault_on_success\": false,\n        \"currency\": null,\n        \"payment\": null\n      },\n      \"detail\": {\n        \"card\": {\n          \"holder_name\": \"John Doe\",\n          \"expiration_month\": 3,\n          \"expiration_year\": 26,\n          \"iin\": \"41111111\",\n          \"lfd\": \"1111\",\n          \"security_code_length\": 3,\n          \"number_length\": 16,\n          \"brand\": \"VISA\",\n          \"issuer_name\": \"JPMORGAN CHASE BANK N A\",\n          \"issuer_code\": null,\n          \"type\": \"CREDIT\",\n          \"category\": \"CREDIT\",\n          \"country_code\": \"US\",\n          \"country_name\": \"United States of America\",\n          \"fingerprint\": \"d244e20d-43a1-43f7-9b48-0a76423be35e\",\n          \"created_at\": \"2024-09-10T15:04:10.453799Z\",\n          \"updated_at\": \"2024-09-10T15:04:10.453800Z\"\n        },\n        \"card_data_history\": [\n         {\n          \"holder_name\": \"John Doe\",\n          \"expiration_month\": 3,\n          \"expiration_year\": 24,\n          \"iin\": \"4222222\",\n          \"lfd\": \"2222\",\n          \"security_code_length\": 3,\n          \"number_length\": 16,\n          \"brand\": \"VISA\",\n          \"issuer_name\": \"JPMORGAN CHASE BANK N A\",\n          \"issuer_code\": null,\n          \"type\": \"CREDIT\",\n          \"category\": \"CREDIT\",\n          \"country_code\": \"US\",\n          \"country_name\": \"United States of America\",\n          \"fingerprint\": \"d244e20d-43a1-43f7-9b48-0a76423be35e\",\n          \"provider_data\": {\n                 \"id\": “MASTERCARD”,\n                 \"status\": “UPDATED\n          },\n          \"created_at\": \"2024-09-10T15:04:10.453799Z\",\n          \"updated_at\": \"2024-09-10T15:04:10.453800Z\"\n        }\n       ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Card networks' compatibility\n\nCard Account Updater is currently available for Visa and Mastercard.\n\n## Activating the Card Account Updater\n\nTo activate Card Account Updater in your Yuno account, contact the Yuno support team at [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bccfc9ccccd3cec8fcc592c9d2d3).

They provide a passive way to transfer data between systems using an HTTP POST request. Once you configure Yuno webhooks, your system will receive event notifications whenever an activity or function occurs within the Yuno flow.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/3dded07-concepts-webhooks.png)\n\n## Why use webhooks?\n\nWebhooks keep your system up to date with payment progress and status changes. Since event notifications trigger automatically, your system does not need to send repeated requests to Yuno. This allows you to process payment information only when needed, improving efficiency.\n\n## Getting started with webhooks\n\nTo use Yuno's webhooks, you must build a public REST API to receive event notifications via POST requests. Your API should not require authentication or access restrictions through headers. Despite being a public API, the system remains secure since Yuno event notifications are not publicly accessible and use a unique URL for communication with your REST API.\n\nUpdated 6 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Payment methods](/docs/payment-methods)[Fraud prevention](/docs/fraud)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Why use webhooks?](#why-use-webhooks)\n  + [Getting started with webhooks](#getting-started-with-webhooks)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/3dded07-concepts-webhooks.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/3dded07-concepts-webhooks.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a diagram showing the different types of the cloud"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}
{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/choose-the-right-integration-for-you", "title": "Choose the Right Integration for You", "content_markdown": "# Choose the Right Integration for You\n\nThis page explains the importance of choosing the right integration, the factors to consider, and the pros and cons of each option.\n\n> 👍\n>\n> ### Recommended Integration\n>\n> We recommend using Seamless SDK options for a smooth integration experience. This option provides a flexible payment solution with pre-built UI components and customization options.\n>\n> **Available Seamless SDK options:**\n>\n> * [Web Seamless SDK](/docs/seamless-sdk-payment-web)\n> * [iOS Seamless SDK](/docs/seamless-sdk-payment-ios)\n> * [Android Seamless SDK](/docs/seamless-sdk-payment-android)\n\n## Why choosing the right integration matters\n\nThe integration method you select affects multiple aspects of your business, including:\n\n1. **Integration and maintenance effort**: The integration type impacts development time and the ongoing maintenance required.\n2. **Effort to add and manage payment methods**: Some integrations allow you to manage payment methods directly from the Yuno dashboard with no coding required, while others may require developer intervention.\n3. **Compliance requirements**: Certain integrations require certifications like PCI-DSS or ISO compliance. If you choose one of these methods, you must provide the necessary certifications to Yuno.\n\n## Integration Types\n\nYuno provides 6 types of integrations. Below, you can see the specifications for each of them.\n\n| Feature | [Full SDK](#full-sdk) | [Seamless SDK](#seamless-sdk) | [Lite SDK](#lite-sdk) | [Secure Fields](#secure-fields-sdk) | [Headless SDK](#headless-sdk) | [Direct](#direct-api) | [Plugins](#plugins) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Add new payment methods without code |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Handle hundreds of payment methods with a single API |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Tokenize cards and payment methods without code |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Use Yuno's PCI-DSS Certification |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Use 3D Secure |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Use an antifraud solution without code |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Set checkout conditions using our dashboard |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Customize the look and feel of your checkout using our dashboard |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n## Integration options\n\n### Full SDK\n\nThe **Full SDK** is Yuno’s most comprehensive integration solution. It streamlines implementation, reduces maintenance and operational overhead, and removes the need to handle compliance, all while offering maximum flexibility. With the Full SDK, you can:\n\n* **User experience management**: Yuno manages the user experience while allowing you to customize the checkout to match your brand.\n* **Payment method configuration**: Add and configure payment methods directly from the dashboard, with no extra coding.\n* **Flexibility and simplicity**: Ideal for businesses that want full control over the experience without managing backend complexity.\n\n### Seamless SDK\n\nA fast and efficient integration that combines API and SDK functionality to simplify payments:\n\n* **Quick integration**: Requires minimal development effort while maintaining a great user experience.\n* **Payment method management**: Users can manage their payment methods while Yuno handles the checkout flow.\n* **Low maintenance**: Reduces integration and maintenance complexity, making it ideal for teams prioritizing simplicity.\n\n### Lite SDK\n\nProvides full control over the checkout frontend while relying on Yuno for backend operations:\n\n* **Backend support**: Yuno provides your backend with a list of available payment methods.\n* **Frontend control**: You decide which methods to display and control the user interface.\n* **Customization**: Ideal for businesses that want a customizable frontend while leveraging Yuno’s backend capabilities.\n\n### Understanding Payment and Enrollment in the Lite SDK\n\nIn the Lite SDK, Payment and Enrollment are handled as separate processes, offering flexibility and control:\n\n**Payment Flow in Lite SDK**: The Lite SDK provides a tailored Payment flow, allowing you to customize the user interface and experience. This gives developers full control over how payments are presented to users, from UI elements to integration details.\n\n**Enrollment Flow in Lite SDK**: Similarly, the Lite SDK also offers an independent Enrollment flow, enabling you to manage customer data storage and other aspects of the enrollment process separately from payments. This flexibility is ideal for applications where Payment and Enrollment need distinct handling.\n\nBy keeping these flows separate, the Lite SDK gives developers more granular control over both processes. This approach is best suited for developers who want to implement custom UI/UX and require more control over how each part of the process works.\n\n**Full SDK**: In contrast, the Full SDK combines both Payment and Enrollment into one seamless, automated flow, automatically handling payment methods, processing, and enrollment. This approach is more streamlined and suited for those seeking a comprehensive solution with minimal setup.\n\n### Secure Fields SDK\n\nA secure and seamless checkout solution using prebuilt UI components for Web, Android, and iOS:\n\n* **Secure data collection**: Simplifies the process of collecting and tokenizing payment card details.\n* **PCI compliance**: Ensures a PCI-compliant experience while maintaining a customized UI.\n* **Balanced solution**: Ideal for businesses looking for a balance between security and flexibility.\n\n### Headless SDK\n\nDesigned for merchants that need complete control over the checkout experience:\n\n* **Custom data capture**: You capture card data on your frontend and send it to Yuno for tokenization.\n* **Tokenization process**: Yuno returns a token that you store and use for payment processing.\n* **No PCI compliance needed**: Since card data never touches your server, PCI compliance is not required.\n* **Full customization**: Ideal for businesses that want custom UX/UI without compliance burdens.\n\n### Direct API\n\nYuno recommends using SDKs over **Direct API** due to the additional complexity involved:\n\n* **Manual compliance management**: Unlike SDKs, **Direct API** requires merchants to manage compliance, fraud prevention, 3DS, and payment provider-specific requirements manually.\n* **Custom API integration**: Merchants can connect directly to Yuno's APIs to process payments if they have custom implementation needs.\n* **PCI certification required**: Businesses must provide an Attestation of Compliance (AOC) before integration.\n* **Access to Yuno API**: While some features are unavailable with this method, you still gain access to Yuno's standardized API, supporting hundreds of payment methods.\n\n### Plugins\n\nPlugins offer the fastest and easiest integration with just a few clicks and basic configuration:\n\n* **Ease of implementation**: Quick setup with minimal development effort.\n* **Platform dependency**: Feature availability depends on the platform’s capabilities.\n\nCurrently, Yuno supports plugin integration with [VTEX](/docs/vtex).\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago\n\n---\n\nWhat’s Next\n\n* [Step by Step Integration Process](/docs/build-your-integration)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Why choosing the right integration matters](#why-choosing-the-right-integration-matters)\n  + [Integration Types](#integration-types)\n  + [Integration options](#integration-options)\n  + - [Full SDK](#full-sdk)\n    - [Seamless SDK](#seamless-sdk)\n    - [Lite SDK](#lite-sdk)\n    - [Understanding Payment and Enrollment in the Lite SDK](#understanding-payment-and-enrollment-in-the-lite-sdk)\n    - [Secure Fields SDK](#secure-fields-sdk)\n    - [Headless SDK](#headless-sdk)\n    - [Direct API](#direct-api)\n    - [Plugins](#plugins)", "images": [], "source": "Yuno Docs"}
{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/monitors", "title": "Monitors", "content_markdown": "# Monitors\n\nYuno's monitors feature helps you detect and address payment processing issues in real-time. This tool automatically identifies anomalies in payment provider performance and takes immediate action to maintain optimal approval rates.\n\nYou can access the Monitors section from your Yuno dashboard to view and manage payment processing anomalies. The monitoring system helps ensure consistent payment processing and high conversion rates across your payment routes.\n\n## Monitoring process operation\n\nThe monitoring process consists of four key steps that help identify and restore payment routes:\n\n1. **Anomaly detection**: The system continuously monitors approval rates over your specified time period. When rates drop below your defined threshold, it triggers alerts through your configured channels like email or **Opsgenie**.\n2. **Alert notification**: If approval rates fall below the threshold, Yuno immediately notifies you through your chosen alert channels.\n3. **Traffic redirection**: Upon detecting low approval rates, Yuno automatically redirects payments to your fallback providers. During this process:\n\n   * A small portion of transactions continues through the original provider to monitor for service recovery\n   * Redirection continues while the fallback provider maintains better performance\n   * If the fallback provider's approval rate drops to match or fall below the original, traffic returns to the initial route\n4. **Route recovery**: When the primary provider's approval rate rises above the threshold again, traffic automatically returns to the original route.\n\nThis automated process helps maintain optimal payment processing by quickly detecting issues and implementing solutions to keep approval rates high.\n\n### Additional monitoring scenarios\n\nThe monitor feature handles various payment route scenarios to maintain optimal processing. Here's how it manages specific situations:\n\nProvider interruptions:\n\n* When a provider has interruptions, traffic automatically redirects to the configured fallback provider\n* If the fallback provider experiences issues, traffic moves to a second fallback provider (if configured)\n* When all providers are unavailable, traffic routes to the provider with the highest recent approval rate\n* The system continuously monitors providers and dynamically adjusts traffic for optimal approval rates\n* Provider status (down/recovered) is determined by your configuration settings\n\nTraffic redirection sequence:\n\n1. When a provider drops below the approval threshold, traffic redirects to the fallback provider\n2. If the fallback provider also drops below threshold, traffic moves to the second fallback (if available)\n3. If all providers are below threshold, traffic routes to whichever provider has the highest approval rate\n\nThe diagram below illustrates these traffic redirection scenarios:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/35125f14b87e13ec56db5c6d5e013af5d42eca8294f65edcabb7ca2da4cf4855-Diagrama_-_Routing_alert.png)\n\n## Configure a monitor\n\nTo configure a monitor for your payment routes:\n\n1. Go to the **Routing** tab in your dashboard and open an existing route. You can set up different approval rate monitors for each condition.\n2. Customize your payment route with your preferred settings.\n3. Add the necessary conditions and payment providers for each set.\n4. Click the Monitors icon (bell) and configure these settings:\n\n   * **Time frame**: Set how long to measure the approval rate\n   * **Approval rate limit**: Set the threshold that triggers alerts and actions\n   * **Number of payments**: Set minimum, maximum, or range of payments needed to trigger the condition. This prevents redirects from anomalies during low payment volumes\n   * **Alert channels**: Choose email or **Opsgenie** notifications\n   * **Automatic traffic redistribution**: Enable automatic redirection when alerts trigger. Requires a fallback provider for **Error** and **Pause** conditions\n   * **Percentage of traffic**: Set how much traffic stays with the original provider for monitoring\n5. Save the monitor changes, or save it as a template for future usage.\n\n[](https://github.com/writechoiceorg/yuno-images/raw/main/doc/yourPaymentsOperationSystem/monitor_v2.mp4)\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Monitor Restriction\n>\n> Monitors cannot be created for routes that are already published.\n\nUpdated 12 days ago\n\n---\n\n[Routing](/docs/routing)[Checkout Builder](/docs/checkout-builder)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Monitoring process operation](#monitoring-process-operation)\n  + - [Additional monitoring scenarios](#additional-monitoring-scenarios)\n  + [Configure a monitor](#configure-a-monitor)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/35125f14b87e13ec56db5c6d5e013af5d42eca8294f65edcabb7ca2da4cf4855-Diagrama_-_Routing_alert.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/35125f14b87e13ec56db5c6d5e013af5d42eca8294f65edcabb7ca2da4cf4855-Diagrama_-_Routing_alert.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a diagram showing the different types of the different types of the device"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}
{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/environments", "title": "Environments", "content_markdown": "# Environments\n\nYuno provides a powerful dual environment feature: Test Mode (Sandbox) and Live Mode (Production). Test Mode allows for safe experimentation, while Live Mode is where your customers interact with your live services.\n\nYuno's dual environment empowers your business to excel in both testing and real-world scenarios. Seamlessly switch between modes using a convenient toggle under a single set of credentials, maintaining top-tier security and functionality.\n\nThis guide will walk you through the transition from Test Mode to Live Mode, ensuring a smooth and secure experience for your business and customers.\n\n## Understanding the environments\n\nYuno has two distinct environments, each serving a specific purpose:\n\n* **Test Mode (Sandbox):** Upon registration, your organization is assigned an \"Inactive\" status. This status provides access exclusively to Test Mode. It allows you to explore the dashboard's features, learn about its functionalities, and experiment without affecting your live operations. Test Mode is an invaluable tool to try out new configurations and features without worrying about the outcome.\n* **Live Mode (Production environment):** To access Live Mode, where real customer interactions occur, you need to initiate an activation request. Once the account is active, the production environment enables real-world operations while ensuring the utmost security and performance. This is where the lessons learned using the Sandbox environment are applied to provide a world-class experience to your customers.\n\n## Transitioning to Live Mode\n\n1. **Requesting activation:** To access Live Mode, submit a request for activation from the dashboard's home page. This request triggers the transition process, and your organization's status will change from \"Inactive\" to \"Under Verification\". Test mode will remain available while the activation takes place.\n2. **Verification process:** Yuno's verification process is typically complete within a few hours, and it's essential to ensure the accuracy and safety of your information. If any additional information is required, our team will promptly reach out for details.\n3. **Access granted:** Once the verification is complete, you'll be granted Live Mode access within the dashboard.\n\n## Seamless environment switching\n\nSwitching between Sandbox and Production environments is remarkably simple:\n\n* **One-click switching:** The dashboard's **Test mode** toogle lets you switch environments in an instant, ensuring smooth navigation and ease of access.\n* **Single username and password:** One set of credential will allow you to use both environments without dealing with multiple passwords or a segmented experience.\n\nUpdated 6 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Country coverage](/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk)[Dashboard Overview](/docs/dashboard-services)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Understanding the environments](#understanding-the-environments)\n  + [Transitioning to Live Mode](#transitioning-to-live-mode)\n  + [Seamless environment switching](#seamless-environment-switching)", "images": [], "source": "Yuno Docs"}
{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/via-api", "title": "Via API", "content_markdown": "# Via API\n\nThis guide provides a step-by-step process for migrating tokens using the Yuno API endpoints. By following the steps outlined, you will compile a list of customers with their enrolled payment methods.\n\n## Requirements\n\nBefore proceeding with the steps in this guide, ensure you have:\n\n* Completed the three steps related to the [importing cards from a gateway account](docs:token-migration-process-copy#importing-cards-from-a-gateway-account) process.\n* Accessed your [API credentials](/docs/developers-credentials) on the Yuno Dashboard, which include:\n  + `public-api-key`\n  + `private-secret-key`\n  + `account_id`\n\nMake sure you have completed these steps and have the necessary data before continuing with the guide.\n\n## Migrate tokens via API\n\n### Step 1: Create customers\n\nTo begin the token migration process, you will use the [Create Customer](/reference/create-customer) endpoint to add customers to the Yuno system. It is important to note that payment methods cannot be enrolled for customers who do not exist in the Yuno system. If the customers are already present in Yuno, you may skip this step.\n\nTo register new customers, provide their personal information. Additionally, you must supply the `merchant_customer_id`, which is a unique identifier for the customer used in your system.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Customer complementary information\n>\n> When creating a customer, certain information is optional but can enhance the user's payment experience if provided. Examples of non-mandatory data include phone number, billing address, and shipping address.\n>\n> If you choose to add optional information, ensure that all required mandatory fields are also provided.\n\nUpon completing the customer creation process, you will receive an `id` that identifies the user within the Yuno system. Use this `id` to enroll the existing payment methods.\n\n### Step 2: Check the customer data (optional)\n\nIn this step, you have the option to verify the information of each registered customer. Use the [Retrieve Customer](/reference/create-customer) endpoint to access the customer data. To do this, provide the `id` that was generated when the customer was initially created.\n\n### Step 3: Enroll a payment method\n\nTo complete the migration process, you need to enroll payment methods for each customer using the third-party vault or gateway data.\n\nUtilize the [Enroll Payment Method](/reference/enroll-payment-method-api) endpoint to register the payment methods. Remember, the `customer_id` required for this request is the `id` obtained during the customer creation in [Step 1](/docs/via-api#step-1-create-customers). Additionally, include the `provider_data` object containing the external provider's token, as shown in the code snippet below:\n\nRequest\n\n```\ncurl --request POST \\\n     --url https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/customers/{{customer_id}}/payment-methods \\\n     --header 'X-Idempotency-Key: <Your X-Idempotency-Key>' \\\n     --header 'accept: application/json' \\\n     --header 'charset: utf-8' \\\n     --header 'content-type: application/json' \\\n     --header 'private-secret-key: <Your private-secret-key>' \\\n     --header 'public-api-key: <Your public-api-key>' \\\n     --data '\n{\n  \"country\": \"BR\",\n  \"type\": \"CARD\",\n  \"workflow\": \"DIRECT\",\n  \"provider_data\": {\n    \"id\": \"MERCADO_PAGO\",\n    \"payment_method_token\": \"{{provider_card_token}}\"\n  },\n  \"account_id\": \"{{account_id}}\" \n}\n'\n```\n\nIn the response from the endpoint, you will receive a `vaulted_token` that identifies the enrolled payment method. This `vaulted_token` will be used for future payments, eliminating the need for additional payment method details.\n\n### Step 4: Check the enrolled payment method (optional)\n\nOnce the payment method is enrolled, you can verify its successful enrollment using the [retrieve enrolled payment methods](/reference/retrieve-enrolled-payment-methods-api) endpoint. Remember, the `customer_id` needed for this request is the `id` obtained during the customer creation in [Step 1](/docs/via-api#step-1-create-customers).\n\nUpdated 5 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Network Token Migration Process](/docs/network-token-migration-process)[Exporting Tokens from Yuno](/docs/exporting-tokens-from-yuno)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Requirements](#requirements)\n  + [Migrate tokens via API](#migrate-tokens-via-api)\n  + - [Step 1: Create customers](#step-1-create-customers)\n    - [Step 2: Check the customer data (optional)](#step-2-check-the-customer-data-optional)\n    - [Step 3: Enroll a payment method](#step-3-enroll-a-payment-method)\n    - [Step 4: Check the enrolled payment method (optional)](#step-4-check-the-enrolled-payment-method-optional)", "images": [], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

To start using it, open your terminal, clone the repository, and change to the cloned directory:\n\nShell\n\n```\n> git clone https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-web.git\n> cd yuno-sdk-web\n```\n\n### Step 2: Update the environment variables\n\nFirst, you need to provide some information to run the application properly. Create a `.env` file in the root folder and define the following variables with your information:\n\n```\nYUNO_X_ACCOUNT_CODE=your_account_code\nYUNO_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your_public_api_key\nYUNO_PRIVATE_SECRET_KEY=your_private_secret_key\n```\n\nYou can find `account_code`, `public_api_key`, and `private_secret_key` in the [Yuno Merchant Dashboard](/reference/authentication).\n\n### Step 3: Start the Demo App\n\nAfter defining the `.env` file, install all dependencies:\n\nShell\n\n```\n> npm install\n```\n\nNow you are ready to run the application using the following command:\n\nShell\n\n```\n> npm start\n```\n\nTo access the running application, open your browser and go to:\n\nShell\n\n```\nhttp://localhost:YOUR-PORT\n```\n\nIf you don't change the code, the application will be available at `http://localhost:8080/` (for local development).\n\nYou can also change the country by adding a query parameter named `country` to the URL with one of the country codes `US`, `GB`, `FR`, `DE`, `IT`, `JP`, `CN`. The following example defines the URL to access an application running on the 8080 port and with Deutschland as the country selected:\n\nShell\n\n```\nhttp://localhost:8080?country=DE\n```\n\nYou will find a panel, as shown below, with all Yuno SDKs available by accessing the URL. Select the desired SDK to see its appearance and how it works.\n\n![Demo App Screenshot](https://github.com/writechoiceorg/yuno-images/blob/main/doc/SDKs/webSDK/new-images/demo-app-1.png?raw=true)\n\n## Stay Updated\n\nVisit the [changelog](/changelog) for the latest SDK updates and version history.\n\nUpdated about 1 month ago\n\n---\n\n[SDK Customizations](/docs/sdk-customizations)[Android SDKs](/docs/android-sdk-integrations)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + - [Step 1: Clone the repository](#step-1-clone-the-repository)\n    - [Step 2: Update the environment variables](#step-2-update-the-environment-variables)\n    - [Step 3: Start the Demo App](#step-3-start-the-demo-app)\n  + [Stay Updated](#stay-updated)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://github.com/writechoiceorg/yuno-images/blob/main/doc/SDKs/webSDK/new-images/demo-app-1.png?raw=true", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/demo-app-1.png", "alt_text": "Demo App Screenshot", "caption_blip": "the checkout screen with the checkout button highlighted"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

As the last step, you have to configure the Webhook URL to receive the updates from the payments.\n   1. Access the [Yuno Dashboard](https://auth.y.uno/u/login?) and select **Developers**.\n   2. Select the **Webhooks** tab.\n   3. Click **add webhook**. The webhook form will show up, where you should provide the following information:\n      1. **Name**: Define a name for the VTEX webhook.\n      2. **Endpoint URL**: You should inform the following URL **`https://{store_name}.myvtex.com/_v/yunopartnerbr.yuno/v4/webhook`** (replace `{store_name}` with your actual store name).\n      3. **x-api-key** and **x-secret**: You can set any information here. For example, you can add **VTEX** for both fields.\n   4. For **Trigger on**, check all events that should notify you through the webhooks. Yuno recommends checking all options.\n   5. Click **Add**.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/ccc5357-image.png)\n\n### PIX payment expiration management\n\nWhen configuring PIX payments with VTEX, Yuno provides automatic expiration handling to prevent order reconciliation issues:\n\n* **Custom expiration tracking (connection level):** Yuno monitors PIX payment expiration based on the `expiration_date` defined in the VTEX–Yuno connection, without relying solely on provider webhooks\n* **Proactive verification:** Before expiration, Yuno makes a request to the provider to confirm whether the payment was completed\n* **Automatic order cancellation:** If a PIX QR code expires unpaid, Yuno marks the payment as expired and immediately notifies VTEX via webhook so the order can be cancelled automatically\n* **Reconciliation consistency:** This ensures payment statuses remain synchronized across VTEX, Yuno, and the payment provider\n\nThis feature is particularly useful to prevent VTEX from continuing to retry expired PIX payments, eliminating status mismatches and reducing reconciliation overhead.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ## Important\n>\n> For VTEX integrations, the `expiration_date` is configured at the **connection level** in Yuno. This enhanced expiration handling only applies when a custom expiration time is set in the connection, not when using the default provider expiration.\n\nAfter completing the steps above, your clients can access a new payment method at checkout.\nFor example, if you configure Visa, when your customers select credit card at checkout, the Yuno checkout will gather all the information required for fraud screening and 3DS services in the background while using the VTEX credit card form.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/a17a02d-vtex.png)\n\nOnce you start receiving payments in VTEX with Yuno, you will be able to see all the information related to the transactions in your [Yuno dashboard](/docs/payments) as a regular payment.\n\n* As additional info in the payment detail, particularly inside the metadata struct, you will also be able to identify the VTEX account related to the payment creation.\n\n  JSON\n\n  ```\n  \"metadata\": [\n      {\n        \"key\": \"vtex_account\",\n        \"value\": \"[your_vtex_subaccount]\"\n      }\n    ]\n  ```\n* When a customer attempts multiple payments and those payments are declined, VTEX activates **Defense Mode**. During this period, VTEX does not execute our payment app, which means Yuno's fraud detection features are disabled. The payment process is delayed by VTEX and forwarded to the Yuno PPF connector. Once received, the Yuno PPF connector will send the payment along with the metadata `defense_mode=true`.\n\n  Yuno recommends configuring a route that bypasses fraud validation whenever the `defense_mode` metadata is set to `true`.\n\n  JSON\n\n  ```\n  \"metadata\": [\n    {\n      \"key\": \"defense_mode\",\n      \"value\": \"[true/false]\"\n    }\n  ]\n  ```\n\n### Customizations\n\nIf you want to add or change certain UX aspects of the checkout, VTEX lets the merchants modify a few things:\n\n* Checkout Page [customizations](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/customization)\n* [Change Payment Method names](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/change-payment-method-names-in-checkout) in Checkout.\n\n### Available options\n\nFor more information on the custom auto capture feature, [refer to the VTEX documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/custom-auto-capture-feature).\n\nUpdated 4 days ago\n\n---\n\n[VTEX](/docs/vtex)[VTEX Headless Integration Guide](/docs/vtex-headless-integration-guide)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [PIX payment expiration management](#pix-payment-expiration-management)\n  + [Customizations](#customizations)\n  + [Available options](#available-options)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/b5feefa-image.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/b5feefa-image.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the settings page in the google search"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/0277803-image.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/0277803-image.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the settings menu in the settings menu"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/f053995-image.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/f053995-image.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the settings page in the wordpress dashboard"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/4ad7929-image.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/4ad7929-image.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the keyboard menu in the keyboard menu"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/cd7de3e-image.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/cd7de3e-image.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the payment screen with the payment options highlighted"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/ccc5357-image.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/ccc5357-image.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the new website page for the new website"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/a17a02d-vtex.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/a17a02d-vtex.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a screenshoto de google"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}
{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/pci-compliance", "title": "PCI Compliance", "content_markdown": "# PCI Compliance\n\nThe user payment experience is related directly to how safe they feel when using your platform to make a payment. Clients are more likely to buy from merchants that keep their sensitive data safe, protecting users from cyber theft and fraud. Therefore, becoming PCI compliant makes you closer to a better user experience and gaining clients’ trust.\n\n## Yuno Solution\n\nWith Yuno's PCI-DSS Level 1 solution, you can securely tokenize your customers' payment information, reducing your PCI scope and ensuring data protection.\n\nTokenization involves collecting sensitive payment details and generating a short-term, single-use token representing this information. Yuno handles and secures sensitive payment data, thereby maintaining PCI compliance on your behalf. Tokenization offers the following advantages:\n\n* **Enhanced checkout experience**: By storing payment methods as tokens, your customers can enjoy a smoother and faster checkout process.\n* **Support for subscription and recurring payments**: Tokenized payment methods can be easily utilized for recurring payment scenarios, enabling seamless subscription billing.\n* **User control over sensitive information**: Yuno enables users to manage their saved cards, giving them control and visibility over sensitive payment information.\n\nYuno simplifies the process of making payments across different providers by tokenizing users' payment information. This means you only need to store a single token, making future payment transactions easier.\n\n![PCI Compliance](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/writechoiceorg/yuno-images/main/doc/PCICompliance/pci_compliance1.png)\n\n## What is PCI compliance?\n\nThe Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of rules which merchants that store, process, or transmit cardholder data must follow. The PCI DSS aims to reduce payment card fraud by establishing the payment ecosystem's foundational security. Your business must meet the requirements and continually document and remediate processes handling cardholder data to be PCI compliant. Governments do not supervise PCI-compliant observance, but card brands can penalize merchants that are not in compliance.\n\n## Who must be PCI compliant\n\nAny enterprise processing, transmitting, or storing individuals’ card data, no matter the size or number of transactions effectuated annually, must be PCI compliant. Therefore, if your business accepts cards as a payment method, it must follow the PCI rules. You still need to be certified even if your operation is based on a third-party solution to handle cardholder data. However, the compliant process is significantly simplified using third-party solutions like Yuno.\n\n## PCI compliance levels\n\nAs a consequence of the company's variety and transaction volume, four PCI compliance levels were defined. Depending on the level of compliance the companies fit, a different amount of security validation is required. The four PCI compliance levels are:\n\n* Level 1: process more than 6M debit or credit card transactions annually\n* Level 2: process between 1M-6M transactions annually\n* Level 3: process between 20K-1M transactions annually\n* Level 4: process less than 20K transactions annually\n\nWhile Level 1 merchants must undergo an internal audit performed by an authorized Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) once a year, other level merchants usually have to submit an Annual Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ).\n\n## How To Become PCI Compliant\n\nThe PCI Security Standards Council developed the requirements to become PCI compliant. There are 12 essential requirements, but depending on the compliance level, you may be required to meet each of the 400+ security controls associated with base requirements, directives, and test procedures. The vast list of conditions involves components to ensure the safety regarding card data handling and storing, as well as annual validation cycles to control and provide the necessary security level.\n\n## How Yuno helps you remain PCI compliant\n\nAt first sight, the list of PCI requirements might seem complex and time-consuming, but the process is very straightforward. You can count on Yuno's help to ensure your cybersecurity, reputation, and long-term sales. Become PCI compliant!\n\nUsing Yuno solutions, the transaction and cardholder data are tokenized. Therefore, merchants no more store or transmit card data through their system, dealing only with non-sensitive data. It is possible because cardholder data are replaced with a unique string of numbers, while Yuno safely stores and processes the sensitive data.\n\nSince your business reduces the contact and exposure of cardholder data, the PCI compliance process is simplified. Instead of an internal audition, you have to complete a questionnaire. Thus, your business saves costs and offers customers a more secure payment experience.\n\nUsing a third-party service like Yuno, you will probably be required to fill out the SAQ A or SAQ D. If all cardholder data functions are outsourced, and your business systems or premises do not store, process, or transmit cardholder data, you would probably need to fill out the SAQ A, composed of 22 questions. On the other hand, if your business does not use outsourced systems and stores card data, you would probably need to fill out the SAQ D, composed of 329 questions.\n\nIn the case of your business integrating the Yuno [Direct Flow](/docs/direct-flow), you must share an Attestation of Compliance (AOC) signed by your company and a certified auditor.\n\n## Take advantage of Yuno solutions\n\nTo leverage the capabilities of Yuno's PCI-DSS Level 1 solution, you can utilize one of our integration options based on Yuno SDKs. Choose from Full Checkout, Lite Checkout, and Secure Fields, each offering unique features to suit your specific requirements. These SDKs are available for both mobile and JavaScript versions.

Download the Google Wallet App from the Play Store.\n6. Navigate through the payment flow to test the integration.\n\nFollowing these steps, you can ensure that Google Pay is integrated into your app and works as expected before making it available for your customers.\n\n## Implementation details\n\nYuno supports both Google Pay API authorization methods:\n\n* **`PAN_ONLY`**: Card credentials stored in the user's Google account. When used, the selected provider handles authentication as configured.\n* **`CRYPTOGRAM_3DS`**: Device-based card credentials with built-in authentication. These credentials include cryptographic authentication.\n\nBoth methods are supported globally across all countries where Yuno operates. On the frontend, include both `PAN_ONLY` and `CRYPTOGRAM_3DS` in your `allowedAuthMethods` array for maximum payment success rates.\n\n* **Provider-specific configuration**: The handling of Google Pay authorization methods may vary depending on your selected provider.

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/nupay", "title": "NuPay", "content_markdown": "# NuPay\n\nThis guide explores Yuno's NuPay integration using the Direct workflow. You'll learn how to:\n\n* Enroll NuPay as a customer payment method\n* Make payments with installments (payment conditions)\n* Set up subscriptions\n\n## Requirements\n\nBefore starting, you need:\n\n* A Yuno account with Dashboard access\n* API keys and an `account_id` (found in dashboard)\n* A customer created in Yuno (or create one in Step 1)\n\n## Create and manage customers\n\nCreate the customer once using your external `merchant_customer_id`, then retrieve by Yuno `id` or by `merchant_customer_id` as needed.\n\n1. Use the [Create Customer](/reference/create-customer) endpoint and provide your own `merchant_customer_id` (the unique id of the customer in your system). The response returns `id` which is the Yuno customer id.\n2. Use [Retrieve Customer](/reference/retrieve-customer) with the Yuno `id`.\n3. Use [Retrieve Customer by External Id](/reference/retrieve-customer-by-external-id) with query parameter `merchant_customer_id`.\n\n## Enroll NuPay payment method\n\nFollow these steps to enroll `NU_PAY_ENROLLMENT` to a customer using the Direct workflow.\n\n### Step 1: Create a customer\n\nIf you don't have a customer yet, create one as shown above. You'll use the returned customer `id`.\n\n### Step 2: Enroll the payment method\n\nUse [Enroll Payment Method](/reference/enroll-payment-method-api) with the following request parameters:\n\n* **type**: `NU_PAY_ENROLLMENT`\n* **account\\_id**: UUID of your account (from the Yuno Dashboard)\n* **workflow**: `DIRECT`\n\nExpected response fields:\n\n* **vaulted\\_token**: UUID for the enrolled payment method\n* **status**: `READY_TO_ENROLL`\n* **sub\\_status**: `WAITING_ADDITIONAL_STEP`\n* **action**: `REDIRECT_URL`\n* **redirect\\_url**: URL to redirect the customer to Nu for authentication\n\n### Step 3: Redirect the customer\n\nRedirect the customer to the `redirect_url`. The customer completes the Nu flow. Nu notifies Yuno of the final state.\n\n### Step 4: Confirm enrollment\n\nUse [Retrieve Enrolled Payment Method by id](/reference/retrieve-enrolled-payment-method-by-id-api) with the `vaulted_token`. A successful enrollment returns:\n\n* **status**: `ENROLLED`\n* **sub\\_status**: `ENROLLED`\n\n> ⚠️\n>\n> The enrollment is only complete after Yuno receives Nu’s confirmation.\n\n## Payments with payment conditions (installments)\n\nAfter enrollment, you can accept payments with NuPay using payment conditions.\n\n### Step 1: Ensure prerequisites\n\nHave a Yuno customer `id` and an enrolled NuPay `vaulted_token`.\n\n### Step 2: Get payment conditions\n\nRequest available installment options for NuPay using the APM installments endpoint.\n\nBash\n\n```\ncurl --location 'https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/apm-installments' \\\n--header 'public-api-key: {{your_public_api_key}}' \\\n--header 'private-secret-key: {{your_secret_api_key}}' \\\n--header 'X-account-code: {{your_account_code}}' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--data '{\n  \"country\": \"BR\",\n  \"amount\": {\n    \"currency\": \"BRL\",\n    \"value\": \"250\"\n  },\n  \"customer\": {\n    \"id\": \"{{customer_id}}\"\n  },\n  \"payment_method\": \"NU_PAY_ENROLLMENT\",\n  \"vaulted_token\": \"{{vaulted_token}}\"\n}'\n```\n\nThe response returns an array of installment plans, including `id`, available `installments`, and amounts. Select a plan `id` and an allowed installments number.\n\n### Step 3: Create payment\n\nUse [Create payment](/reference/create-payment) with the Direct workflow and NuPay type. Include the selected plan id and installments in the wallet `card_data`.\n\nJSON\n\n```\n{\n  \"description\": \"test\",\n  \"account_id\": \"{{account_id}}\",\n  \"merchant_order_id\": \"0000023\",\n  \"country\": \"BR\",\n  \"merchant_reference\": \"ref-merchant-AA01\",\n  \"amount\": {\n    \"currency\": \"BRL\",\n    \"value\": 250\n  },\n  \"customer_payer\": {\n    \"id\": \"{{customer_id}}\"\n  },\n  \"workflow\": \"DIRECT\",\n  \"callback_url\": \"https://your-callback.com\",\n  \"payment_method\": {\n    \"type\": \"NU_PAY_ENROLLMENT\",\n    \"vaulted_token\": \"{{vaulted_token}}\",\n    \"detail\": {\n      \"wallet\": {\n        \"card_data\": {\n          \"installments_plan_id\": \"{{plan_id}}\",\n          \"installments\": 2\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4: Retrieve payment\n\nUse [Retrieve payment by id](/reference/retrieve-payment-by-id) to confirm final status.\n\n## Subscription flow\n\nYou can use NuPay for recurring charges.\n\n1. Create a customer\n2. Enroll NuPay as a payment method (see above)\n3. Create a subscription with the enrolled `vaulted_token` using [Create subscription](/reference/create-subscription)\n4. Retrieve the subscription using [Retrieve subscription](/reference/retrieve-subscription)\n\n> ⚠️\n>\n> ### Limitations\n>\n> * Subscriptions with NuPay do not support payment conditions (installments)\n> * Creating subscriptions directly within a payment request is not supported\n\n## Endpoints\n\n* [Create customer](/reference/create-customer)\n* [Retrieve customer](/reference/retrieve-customer)\n* [Retrieve customer by external id](/reference/retrieve-customer-by-external-id)\n* [Enroll payment method (Direct)](/reference/enroll-payment-method-api)\n* [Retrieve enrolled payment method by id](/reference/retrieve-enrolled-payment-method-by-id-api)\n* [Create payment](/reference/create-payment)\n* [Retrieve payment by id](/reference/retrieve-payment-by-id)\n* [Create subscription](/reference/create-subscription)\n* [Retrieve subscription](/reference/retrieve-subscription)\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Click to Pay](/docs/click-to-pay)[Aida AI Agent](/docs/aida-ai-agent)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Requirements](#requirements)\n  + [Create and manage customers](#create-and-manage-customers)\n  + [Enroll NuPay payment method](#enroll-nupay-payment-method)\n  + - [Step 1: Create a customer](#step-1-create-a-customer)\n    - [Step 2: Enroll the payment method](#step-2-enroll-the-payment-method)\n    - [Step 3: Redirect the customer](#step-3-redirect-the-customer)\n    - [Step 4: Confirm enrollment](#step-4-confirm-enrollment)\n  + [Payments with payment conditions (installments)](#payments-with-payment-conditions-installments)\n  + - [Step 1: Ensure prerequisites](#step-1-ensure-prerequisites)\n    - [Step 2: Get payment conditions](#step-2-get-payment-conditions)\n    - [Step 3: Create payment](#step-3-create-payment)\n    - [Step 4: Retrieve payment](#step-4-retrieve-payment)\n  + [Subscription flow](#subscription-flow)\n  + [Endpoints](#endpoints)", "images": [], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/enrollment-lite-sdk", "title": "Lite SDK (Enrollment Web)", "content_markdown": "# Lite SDK (Enrollment Web)\n\n> 👍\n>\n> ### Recommended SDK\n>\n> We recommend using the [Web Seamless SDK](seamless-sdk-payment-web) for a smooth integration experience. This option provides a flexible payment solution with pre-built UI components and customization options.\n\nFollow this step-by-step guide to implement and enable Yuno's Lite Web SDK enrollment functionality in your application.\n\n## Step 1: Include the library in your project\n\nBefore proceeding with the Lite SDK implementation, please refer to the [SDK Integration Overview](/docs/build-your-integration) for detailed instructions on how to properly integrate the SDK into your project.\n\nThe integration guide provides three flexible methods:\n\n1. Direct HTML script inclusion\n2. Dynamic JavaScript injection\n3. NPM module installation\n\nChoose the integration method that best suits your development workflow and technical requirements. After completing the SDK integration, you can proceed with the following steps to implement the lite enrollment functionality.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### TypeScript Library\n>\n> If you are using TypeScript, Yuno provides a [library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yuno-payments/sdk-web-types) that you can use to see all available methods available in the Yuno Web SDK.\n\n## Step 2: Initialize SDK with the public key\n\nIn your JavaScript application, create an instance of the `Yuno` class by providing a valid **PUBLIC\\_API\\_KEY**. Check the [Get your API credentials](/docs/developers-credentials) guide if you do not have your credentials. In the example below, the initialized class is attributed to the `yuno`constant.\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst yuno = await Yuno.initialize(PUBLIC_API_KEY);\n```\n\n## Step 3: Create a customer session and an enrollment payment method object\n\nBefore continuing with the process, you will need to create a [customer session](/reference/create-customer-session) and a [payment method object](/reference/enroll-payment-method-checkout) to use in the setup of your SDK Lite integration for enrollment. While creating the payment method object, you will need to define which one is going to be available for your customer to enroll (in the case of SDK Lite, only CARD is available).\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Verify\n>\n> In case you want to verify cards (zero value authorization) before the enrollment, you can complete the `verify` struct while defining the payment method object for the customer session.\n\n## Step 4: Mount the enrollment lite\n\nThe configuration and mounting are done in the same step for the Enrollment Lite. To do it, use the `yuno.mountEnrollmentLite` function and provide the necessary parameters. The following table lists all parameters and their descriptions.\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `customerSession` | Refers to the current payment's [customer session](/reference/create-customer). Example: `'e15648b0-fcd5-4799-a14c-cc463ae8a133'`. |\n| `country_code` | This parameter specifies the country for which the payment process is being set up. Use an `ENUM` value representing the desired country code. You can find the full list of supported countries and their corresponding codes on the [Country Coverage](/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk) page. |\n| `language` | Defines the language to be used in the payment forms. You can set it to one of the available language options: `es` (Spanish), `en` (English), `pt` (Portuguese), `fil` (Filipino), `id` (Indonesian), `ms` (Malay), or `th` (Thai). |\n| `showLoading` | Control the visibility of the Yuno loading/spinner page during the payment process. |\n| `onLoading` | Required to receive notifications about server calls or loading events during the payment process. |\n| `elementSelector` | Specifies the HTML element where you want to mount the Yuno SDK. The SDK will be rendered within this element. |\n| `card` | Define specific settings for the credit card form. |\n| `yunoEnrollmentStatus` | Define a callback to run after the enrollment process ends. It is called with `vaultedToken` and `status` parameters. The `status` returned can be one of: |\n|  | * `CREATED`: It is an initial and transitory state, only indicating that it is created and updated to another state. |\n|  | * `EXPIRED`: For asynchronous enrollments, such as MercadoPago, where the user has to take an external action and may never do so. |\n|  | * `REJECTED`: We reject it from our side. It may be because they entered incorrect Yuno credentials or are sending some data incorrectly. |\n|  | * `READY_TO_ENROLL`: It follows `CREATED` if everything is okay, indicating that the enrollment has started. |\n|  | * `ENROLL_IN_PROCESS`: For asynchronous enrollments, like MercadoPago, where the user has to take an action externally. It indicates that the user is performing the action. |\n|  | * `UNENROLL_IN_PROCESS`: For asynchronous unenrollments, in case the provider has an asynchronous response. Currently, there are none. |\n|  | * `ENROLLED`: Successfully enrolled. |\n|  | * `DECLINED`: The provider declined the enrollment. Does not include cards. |\n|  | * `CANCELED`: The enrollment flow is canceled halfway. |\n|  | * `ERROR`: There was an ERROR in the service or credentials. |\n|  | * `UNENROLLED`: The previously enrolled payment method has been unenrolled. |\n| `issuersFormEnable` | Enable the issuer's form (bank list). |\n| `texts` | Provide custom text for payment form buttons to match your application's language or branding. |\n| `card.isCreditCardProcessingOnly` | Enables you to ensure that all card transactions are processed as credit only. This option is helpful in markets where cards can act as both credit and debit. To enable, set the `isCreditCardProcessingOnly` to `true` to ensure that all card transactions are processed as credit. This parameter is not required. |\n\nThe next code block presents an example of the Enrollment Lite parameter configuration and mounting.\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyuno.mountEnrollmentLite({\n  customerSession: 'e15648b0-fcd5-4799-a14c-cc463ae8a133',\n  /**\n   * The complete list of country codes is available on https://docs.y.uno/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk\n   */\n  country_code: country,\n  /**\n  * Language can be one of en, fr, jp\n  * Default is browser language\n  */\n  language: 'en',\n  /**\n   * Hide or show the Yuno loading/spinner page\n   * Default is true\n   * @optional\n   */\n  showLoading: true,\n  /**\n   * Required if you'd like to be informed if there is a server call\n   * @param { isLoading: boolean, type: 'DOCUMENT' | 'ONE_TIME_TOKEN'  } data\n   * @optional\n   */\n  onLoading: (args) => {\n    console.log(args);\n  }\n  /**\n   *  API card\n   *  @optional\n   */\n  card: {\n    /**\n     * Mode render card can be step or extends\n     * Default extends\n     */\n    type: \"extends\",\n    /**\n     * You can edit card form styles\n     * Only you should write css, then it will be injected into the iframe\n     * Example\n     * `@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Luckiest+Guy&display=swap');\n     *  .Yuno-front-side-card__name-label {\n     *    color: red !important;\n     *    font-family: 'Luckiest Guy' !important;\n     *   }`\n     */\n    styles: '',\n    /**\n     * Show checkbox for save/enroll card\n     * Default is false\n     */\n    cardSaveEnable: false,\n    /**\n     * Custom texts in Card forms buttons\n     * Example:\n     *\n     *  texts: {\n     *    cardForm?: {\n     *      enrollmentSubmitButton?: string;\n     *       paymentSubmitButton?: string;\n     *     }\n     *     cardStepper?: {\n     *       numberCardStep?: {\n     *         nextButton?: string;\n     *       },\n     *       cardHolderNameStep?: {\n     *         prevButton?: string;\n     *         nextButton?: string;\n     *       },\n     *       expirationDateStep?: {\n     *         prevButton?: string;\n     *         nextButton?: string;\n     *       },\n     *       cvvStep?: {\n     *         prevButton?: string;\n     *         nextButton?: string;\n     *       }\n     *     }\n     *  }\n     */\n    texts: {},\n    /**\n     * Hide or show the document fields into card form\n     * Default is true\n     * @optional\n     */\n    documentEnable: true,\n  },\n  /**\n   * Call back is called with the following object\n   * @param {{\n   *  status: 'CREATED'\n   *    | 'EXPIRED',\n   *    | 'REJECTED',\n   *    | 'READY_TO_ENROLL',\n   *    | 'ENROLL_IN_PROCESS',\n   *    | 'UNENROLL_IN_PROCESS',\n   *    | 'ENROLLED',\n   *    | 'DECLINED',\n   *    | 'CANCELED',\n   *    | 'ERROR',\n   *    | 'UNENROLLED',\n   *  vaultedToken: string,\n   * }}\n   */\n  yunoEnrollmentStatus: ({ status, vaultedToken}) => {\n    console.log('status', { status, vaultedToken})\n  },\n  /**\n   * If this is called the SDK should be mounted again\n   * @param { error: 'CANCELED_BY_USER' | any }\n   * @optional\n   */\n  yunoError: (error) => {\n    console.log('There was an error', error)\n  },\n});\n```\n\n## `continuePayment` return value or null\n\nFor payment methods that require merchant-side action (e.g., when the payment provider requires a redirect URL in a webview), the `await yuno.continuePayment()` method will return either an object with the following structure or null:\n\nTypeScript\n\n```\n{\n  action: 'REDIRECT_URL'\n  type: string\n  redirect: {\n    init_url: string\n    success_url: string\n    error_url: string\n  }\n} | null\n```\n\nWhen the method returns an object, it allows you to handle your application's payment flows that require custom redirect handling. When it returns null, no additional merchant-side action is needed.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Demo App\n>\n> In addition to the code examples provided, you can access the [Demo App](/docs/demo-app) for a complete implementation of Yuno SDKs. The demo app includes working examples of all Yuno SDKs and can be cloned from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-web).\n\n## Complementary features\n\nYuno Web SDK provides additional services and configurations you can use to improve customers' experience:\n\n* [Loader](#loader)\n* [Mode of form rendering](#mode-of-form-rendering)\n* [Card form configuration](#card-form-configuration)\n  + [Text payment form button](#text-payment-form-button)\n* [SDK Customization](#sdk-customization)\n\n### Loader\n\nControl the use of the loader.\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `showLoading` | You can hide or show the Yuno loading/spinner page. Enabling this option ensures that the loading component remains displayed until either the `hideLoader()` or `continuePayment()` function is called. The default value is true. |\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyuno.startCheckout({\n  showLoading: true,\n});\n```\n\n### Mode of form rendering\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `renderMode` | This parameter is optional. It determines the mode in which the payment forms will be displayed. |\n|  | * `type`: can be one of `modal` or `element`. |\n|  | * `elementSelector`: Element where the form will be rendered. Only required if `type` is `element`. |\n| `elementSelector` | Required only if the type is `element`. Specifies the HTML elements where you want to mount the Yuno SDK. You can specify the elements using one of the following options: |\n|  | * **String (Deprecated)**: Provide the ID or selector of the element where the SDK should be mounted. |\n|  | * **Object**: Specify the elements for mounting the APM and action forms. You need to provide the element for the `apmForm`, which is where the APM is displayed, and the element for the `actionForm`, where the Continue Payment button appears.

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/vtex", "title": "VTEX", "content_markdown": "# VTEX\n\nYuno and VTEX have joined forces to simplify payment processes for merchants worldwide. This partnership aims to streamline the payment experience and provide merchants with various payment methods catering to their customer's preferences.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/64caa7b-vtex1.png)\n\nBy integrating Yuno's payment orchestration platform with VTEX's e-commerce solution, merchants can easily manage payments and offer diverse payment options. Yuno ensures customers can choose their preferred payment method from local cards to digital wallets. Yuno's plugin allows your store to accept payments seamlessly without redirecting customers to external pages, enhancing the shopping experience and increasing the conversion rate.\n\n> ❗️\n>\n> ### Payments with two cards\n>\n> To enable your customers to pay using two cards in VTEX, you must contact the Yuno supporting team in advance.\n\nYuno's plugin for VTEX is PCI compliant, ensuring that Yuno meets rigorous security standards when handling card data. Merchants can have peace of mind knowing that their customers' payment information is handled with utmost security and privacy.\n\nThe seamless integration between Yuno and VTEX makes it easy for merchants to incorporate Yuno's payment orchestration system into their existing setup. This enables them to focus on delivering exceptional products and services while providing a smooth payment experience for their customers.\n\n## Payment methods available\n\nAll the payment methods that Yuno offers are available in VTEX, including credit/debit cards and alternative payment methods. Our team is actively collaborating with VTEX to ensure that all Yuno connections are made available to you as soon as possible. We are committed to expanding the available payment options to enhance your experience, so please feel free to reach out to your key account manager to find out more about the available payment methods in VTEX.\n\n## Plugin integration\n\nTo start using the Yuno plugin on your VTEX store, you will need two essential elements:\n\n1. A VTEX store.  \n   You will use the Application Key and the Application Token from your store account. Check the VTEX [Application Keys](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/application-keys--2iffYzlvvz4BDMr6WGUtet#) tutorials to understand how to set and access this information.\n   1. Application Key: a private key generated when the Yuno account became productive.\n   2. Application Token: a productive public key generated when the Conekta account became productive.\n2. A Yuno account.  \n   If you don't have a Yuno account, sign up at the [Yuno Merchant Dashboard](https://auth.y.uno/u/signup). You will use your Account ID, Public API Key, and Private API Key from your Yuno account. Access the [Developers](/docs/developers-credentials) tab on the Yuno dashboard to access your credentials.\n\nOnce you have this information, you can register the Yuno plugin affiliation. Follow the steps outlined in the [Configure Yuno as Provider](/docs/configure-yuno-as-provider) page. After completing the configuration processes, you'll enable your clients on VTEX to access the Yuno checkout to make payments on their orders.\n\n## Workspaces\n\nWorkspaces are environments isolated from each other in terms of app development. They can be understood as different versions of the same VTEX account. In practice, changes performed in a particular workspace do not affect your store's live version or other developers' work. If you're used to working with git, think of workspaces as branches.\n\n### Workspace types\n\n**Development workspace**: Mainly used by software developers to draft, build or extend VTEX IO apps and storefront themes. These workspaces provide more development freedom. They allow linking, installing, and publishing VTEX IO apps. They can't handle production traffic, be promoted to master, nor be used for A/B testing.\n\n**Production workspace**: Mainly used by the quality assurance and development teams to validate VTEX IO apps. These workspaces support production traffic and can be used for A/B testing, but linking apps is forbidden. If desired, these workspaces can be promoted to master to become publicly available for all end-users.\n\n**Master workspace**: A unique production workspace that reflects the content served to the end-users of a store.  \nDevelopment and production workspaces can be accessed at `https://{workspace}--{account}.myvtex.com`.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/b8b6f032beb910a75fa3fadd25efb6b2b3e42d132f5712dedbf727d12f8424f6-image.png)\n\n## Creating a workspace\n\n### Step 1 - Installing the VTEX IO CLI\n\nAny development in VTEX IO begins and ends with the VTEX IO CLI, which works as a communication gateway between your store and the VTEX IO development platform. With VTEX IO’s CLI, you can use the terminal to log in to your VTEX account, manage workspaces, develop apps, and install new ones.\n\n1. Install the VTEX IO CLI on your machine by following [this guide](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-vtex-io-cli-install).\n2. Check if the installation was successful by running VTEX.\n\n### Step 2 - Logging in to your VTEX account\n\nAfter installing the VTEX IO CLI in your machine, take the following steps to log in to your VTEX account.\n\n1. Log in to your VTEX account by running the following command:\n\n```\nvtex login accountName\n```\n\nReplace `accountName` with the name of your VTEX account.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/645257d1c276516b93eb8a14f35a99913fef9fd34e99db6ad02f4f977842ba61-image.png)\n\n2. After running the command, a browser window will open and ask for your credentials. Enter the information required to log in to your account.\n\n### Step 3 - Creating a development workspace\n\nWhen developing with VTEX IO, you'll use different workspaces. Workspaces are environments isolated from one another. They can be understood as different versions of the same VTEX account. In practice, changes performed in a particular workspace do not affect your store's live version or other developers' work.\n\nWhen you log in to a VTEX account using the VTEX IO CLI, you are automatically in the master workspace, which is the version of your store available to end-users. Hence, to avoid changing your store's live version, you must create a development workspace.\n\n1. Create a development workspace by running the following command:\n\n```\nvtex use exampleworkspace\n```\n\nReplace `exampleworkspace` with a name of your choosing to identify your new workspace.\n\n2. Enter Y to create the new workspace.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/9bd9d720c54bf3a631f4db6bea0f19fbfd18f32863685bd4a45254af462cbce3-image.png)\n\nAfter running this command, you'll be taken to the exampleworkspace workspace, and all your operations will now run in this specified workspace.\n\n### Step 4 - Accessing your store using a workspace\n\nAfter creating a new development workspace, you can access this version of your store by going to: `https://exampleworkspace--accountName.myvtex.com`, where:\n\n* `exampleworkspace` - Name of the workspace that you've just created.\n* `accountName` - Name of the VTEX account in which you are working.\n\nDone! You're now ready to start developing your Pixel app!\n\n### Using a workspace in a connector\n\nNow that you have a new connector ready to be used, you can test it entirely in the production flow using your store's Checkout.\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> The account must be allowed to test IO Connectors. This must be [requested via ticket](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/opening-tickets-to-vtex-support--16yOEqpO32UQYygSmMSSAM) informing the name of the app and the account where the tests will be made.\n\nA prerequisite for this procedure is to have products for sale at your store for testing. To place an order with your new connector:\n\n1. Launch a beta version of your connector. E.g.: `[email protected]`. If you need, check the [Making your app publicly available](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/vtex-io-documentation-10-making-your-app-publicly-available#launching-a-new-version) article to learn how to create a beta version of your app.\n2. Install the beta version on master workspace. Wait for around 1 hour.\n3. Go to `https://{account}myvtex.com/admin/affiliations/connector/Vtex.PaymentGateway.Connectors.PaymentProvider.PaymentProviderConnector_{connector-name}/`. Replace `{account}` for the name of the account you want to test on and `{connector-name}` for the name of your connector. The format of the name is: `${vendor}-${appName}-${appMajor}` (e.g.: `vtex-payment-provider-example-v1`).\n4. ![](https://files.readme.io/9b547d5fdb3bbc1e5d771fbac749ced300591d746206eef57c8427eb54554cac-image.png)\n\n   In **Payment Control**, activate the test environment by clicking **Enable test mode**. A new field called **Workspace** will appear.\n5. Set the **Workspace** as you wish. You can leave it as `master` if it is the workspace you want to test on.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/d95b2da1854ee41fdb44002702b3e1385d4c8b20218eb25c9480f2c017e3a96f-image.png)\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Exporting Tokens from Yuno](/docs/exporting-tokens-from-yuno)[Configure Yuno as Provider](/docs/configure-yuno-as-provider)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Payment methods available](#payment-methods-available)\n  + [Plugin integration](#plugin-integration)\n  + [Workspaces](#workspaces)\n  + - [Workspace types](#workspace-types)\n  + [Creating a workspace](#creating-a-workspace)\n  + - [Step 1 - Installing the VTEX IO CLI](#step-1---installing-the-vtex-io-cli)\n    - [Step 2 - Logging in to your VTEX account](#step-2---logging-in-to-your-vtex-account)\n    - [Step 3 - Creating a development workspace](#step-3---creating-a-development-workspace)\n    - [Step 4 - Accessing your store using a workspace](#step-4---accessing-your-store-using-a-workspace)\n    - [Using a workspace in a connector](#using-a-workspace-in-a-connector)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/64caa7b-vtex1.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/64caa7b-vtex1.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "yno vx logo"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/b8b6f032beb910a75fa3fadd25efb6b2b3e42d132f5712dedbf727d12f8424f6-image.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/b8b6f032beb910a75fa3fadd25efb6b2b3e42d132f5712dedbf727d12f8424f6-image.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a diagram showing the different types of workspaces"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/645257d1c276516b93eb8a14f35a99913fef9fd34e99db6ad02f4f977842ba61-image.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/645257d1c276516b93eb8a14f35a99913fef9fd34e99db6ad02f4f977842ba61-image.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a computer screen with a black background and a green and blue text"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/9bd9d720c54bf3a631f4db6bea0f19fbfd18f32863685bd4a45254af462cbce3-image.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/9bd9d720c54bf3a631f4db6bea0f19fbfd18f32863685bd4a45254af462cbce3-image.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a black screen with a white text that reads, ' what is the difference?

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/secure-fields-enrollment", "title": "Secure Fields (Enrollment)", "content_markdown": "# Secure Fields (Enrollment)\n\nFollow this step-by-step guide to implement and enable Yuno's Secure Fields Enrollment functionality in your application.\n\n## Step 1: Include the library in your project\n\nBefore proceeding with the Secure Fields implementation, see the [SDK Integration Overview](/docs/build-your-integration) for detailed instructions on how to properly integrate the SDK into your project.\n\nThe integration guide provides three flexible methods:\n\n1. Direct HTML script inclusion\n2. Dynamic JavaScript injection\n3. NPM module installation\n\nChoose the integration method that best suits your development workflow and technical requirements. After completing the SDK integration, you can proceed with the following steps to implement the secure fields functionality.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### TypeScript Library\n>\n> If you are using TypeScript, Yuno provides a [library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yuno-payments/sdk-web-types) that you can use to see all available methods in the Yuno Web SDK.\n\n### Step 2: Initialize secure fields with the public key\n\nGet a `Yuno` instance class in your JavaScript application with a valid `PUBLIC_API_KEY`:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst yuno = await Yuno.initialize(PUBLIC_API_KEY);\n```\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Credentials\n>\n> See the credentials page for more information: [https://docs.y.uno/reference/authentication](/reference/authentication)\n\n### Step 3: Create a customer session and an enrollment payment method object\n\nBefore continuing with the process, you will need to create a [customer session](/reference/create-customer-session) and a [payment method object](/reference/enroll-payment-method-checkout) to use in the setup of your secure fields integration for enrollment. While creating the payment method object, you will need to define which one will be available for your customer to enroll (in the case of secure fields, only CARD is available).\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Verify\n>\n> If you need to verify cards through a zero-value authorization before enrolling a customer, you can include the `verify` structure when defining the payment method object for the customer session.\n\n### Step 4: Start the enrollment process\n\nNext, you have to create a configuration object. The essential parameters are the `countryCode`, which determines the country for which the enrollment process is configured, and `customerSession`, which refers to the current enrollment's customer session.\n\n### Parameters\n\nConfigure the secure fields with the following options:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `countryCode` | This parameter specifies the country for which the payment process is being set up. Use an `ENUM` value representing the desired country code. You can find the full list of supported countries and their corresponding codes on the [Country Coverage](/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk) page. |\n| `customerSession` | Refers to the current enrollment's customer session. `Example: '438413b7-4921-41e4-b8f3-28a5a0141638'` |\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst secureFields = yuno.secureFields({\n  countryCode: \"CO\",\n  customerSession: \"eec6578e-ac2f-40a0-8065-25b5957f6dd3\"\n});\n```\n\n### Step 5: Mount the Secure Fields\n\nAfter defining the parameters, you will define, configure, and mount the Secure Fields. For each Secure Field, you need to define the `name` and `options` when creating it with the `secureFields.create` function.\n\nThe following table shows all configurations available:\n\n| Parameters | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `name` | The available names for field names are **cvv**, **pan**, or **expiration**. |\n| `options.placeholder` | Default placeholder for the field. |\n| `options.styles` | Additional CSS styles for the current field. |\n| `options.label` | Field visible label. |\n| `options.showError` | Defines if errors will be shown. Available options are `true` and `false`. |\n| `options.onChange` | An auxiliary function that can be configured and will run when the field content changes. Indicates if the fields have errors. |\n| `options.onBlur` | An auxiliary function that can be configured and will run when blurring from the input. |\n| `options.validateOnBlur` | Change the validation behavior, improving the user experience by providing validation feedback after the field loses focus. It is an optional parameter that is `false` as default. |\n| `options.onFocus` | An auxiliary function that can be configured and will run when focussing on the input. |\n| `options.onRenderedSecureField` | An auxiliary function that can be configured and will run when the element finishes rendering |\n| `options.errorMessage` | This allows for the definition of the field's error message. |\n\nOnce you have set the parameter, you will render the created Secure Field with the `render` function by selecting an HTML element using a valid CSS selector (`#`, `.`, `[data-*]`).\n\nThe following code block shows an example of the parameter configuration for three Secure Fields, and as they are mounted, the fields are presented to the user:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst secureNumber = secureFields.create({\n  name: 'pan',\n  options: {\n    placeholder: '0000 0000 0000 0000',\n    styles: ``,\n    label: 'Card Number',\n    showError: true,\n    errorMessage: \"Custom Error\",\n    validateOnBlur: false,\n    onChange: ({ error, data }) => {\n      if (error) {\n        console.log('error_pan')\n      } else {\n        console.log('not_error_pan')\n      }\n    },\n    onBlur() {\n      console.log('blur_pan')\n    },\n    onFocus: () => {\n      console.log('focus_pan')\n    },\n    onRenderedSecureField: ()=> {\n      console.log('render completed')\n    }\n  },\n})\n\nsecureNumber.render('#pan')\n\nconst secureExpiration = secureFields.create({\n  name: 'expiration',\n  options: {\n    placeholder: 'MM / YY',\n    styles: ``,\n    label: 'Card Expiration',\n    showError: true,\n    onChange: ({ error }) => {\n      if (error) {\n        console.log('error_expiration')\n      } else {\n        console.log('not_error_expiration')\n      }\n    },\n    onBlur() {\n      console.log('blur_expiration')\n    },\n    onFocus: () => {\n      console.log('focus_expiration')\n    },\n    onRenderedSecureField: ()=> {\n      console.log('render completed')\n    }\n  },\n})\n\nsecureExpiration.render('#expiration')\n\nconst secureCvv = secureFields.create({\n  name: 'cvv',\n  options: {\n    placeholder: 'CVV',\n    styles: ``,\n    label: 'CVV',\n    showError: true,\n    onChange: ({ error }) => {\n      if (error) {\n        console.log('error_cvv')\n      } else {\n        console.log('not_error_cvv')\n      }\n    },\n    onBlur() {\n      console.log('blur_cvv')\n    },\n    onFocus: () => {\n      console.log('focus_cvv')\n    },\n    onRenderedSecureField: ()=> {\n      console.log('render completed')\n    }\n  },\n})\n\nsecureCvv.render('#cvv')\n```\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Enrollment for Payouts\n>\n> If you are enrolling a credit card for the payouts flow, only the credit/debit pan is required, so you can just use the `secureNumber` object before creating the vaulted\\_token and ignore the `secureExpiration` and `secureCvv` objects.\n\nAfter they are mounted, the three secure fields will be shown:\n\n### Step 6: Create Vaulted Token\n\nTo enroll, create a Vaulted Token:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst vaultedToken = await secureFields.generateVaultedToken({\n  cardHolderName: 'John Deer',\n  customer: {\n    document: {\n      document_number: '1090209924',\n      document_type: 'CC',\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\nIf you need the full response, you can use `secureFields.generateVaultedTokenWithInformation`\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\n *   name: string;\n *   description: string;\n *   status: Enrollment.Status;\n *   type: Payment.Type;\n *   category: Payment.Category;\n *   provider: {\n *       type: string;\n *       action: string;\n *       token: string;\n *       enrollment_id: string | null;\n *       provider_status: string | null;\n *       redirect: string | null;\n *       raw_response: unknown;\n *   };\n *   created_at: Date;\n *   updated_at: Date;\n *  }\n */ \nGenerate a vaulted token with customer information:\n\n```javascript\nconst vaultedTokenWithInformation = await secureFields.generateVaultedTokenWithInformation({\n  cardHolderName: 'John Deer',\n  customer: {\n    document: {\n      document_number: '1090209924',\n      document_type: 'CC',\n    },\n  },\n})\n```\n\n## Demo\n\nIn addition to the code examples provided, you can access the [Demo App](/docs/demo-app) for a complete implementation of Yuno Secure Fields.

You'll learn how to:\n\n* Set up your Yuno account\n* Configure your first payment connection\n* Set up payment routing\n* Enable payment methods\n* Obtain API credentials\n\n### Step 1: Create your account on Yuno\n\nTo create your Yuno account:\n\n1. Contact [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f88b99949d8bb881d68d9697) to request a new account\n2. Look for a verification email from the Yuno team and follow the instructions to verify your identity\n3. Once verified, you'll receive your Yuno account credentials\n4. Log into the [Yuno dashboard](https://dashboard.y.uno/) using your credentials\n\n![Account creation process](https://files.readme.io/4e69b61-register_yuno_V2.png)\n\nAfter accessing the dashboard, follow the steps below to enable payment methods. Repeat these steps each time you want to add a new payment method.\n\n### Step 2: Set up your first connection\n\nTo set up your first payment connection:\n\n1. Navigate to [Connections](https://dashboard.y.uno/connections) in the dashboard sidebar\n2. Search for \"Yuno Test Payment Gateway\" in the search bar\n3. Click **Connect** next to the gateway\n4. Enter a descriptive name for the connection, and follow the on-screen prompts\n5. Click **Save**\n\nThe dashboard will display a confirmation message when your connection is successfully added.\n\n[](https://github.com/writechoiceorg/yuno-images/raw/main/doc/set_up_you_account/connection_setup_V4_v2.mp4)\n\n### Step 3: Set up routing for your new connection\n\nAfter adding a connection, you need to assign it to a route. Routes determine which provider processes payments. While you can configure multiple routes and processors for each payment method, this guide covers a basic setup where all payments are processed through the Yuno Test Payment Gateway connection.\n\nTo set up routing:\n\n1. Navigate to [Routing](https://dashboard.y.uno/routing) in the dashboard sidebar\n2. Click the **Not published** tab to view payment methods with available connections but no configured routes\n3. Find the **Card** payment method and click **Set Up**\n4. In the popup window:\n   * Click **+ Create new route**\n   * Enter a descriptive name\n   * Click **Save**\n5. Click the arrow and select **Add step**\n6. Choose **Yuno Test Payment Gateway** from the list and click **Select**\n7. Click **Publish** to save all changes\n\nOnce published, you'll find your new route in the Published tab. This means the Card payment method will process all transactions through your configured route.\n\n[](https://github.com/writechoiceorg/yuno-images/raw/main/doc/set_up_you_account/routing_V2.mp4)\n\n### Step 4: Enable the payment method in the checkout builder\n\nAfter configuring your connection and routing, enable the Card payment method to make it available in your checkout:\n\n1. Navigate to [Checkout Builder](https://dashboard.y.uno/checkout-builder) in the dashboard sidebar\n2. Locate the Card payment method in the list of available methods\n3. Toggle the switch next to Card to enable it\n4. Click **Publish settings** apply your changes\n\n[](https://github.com/writechoiceorg/yuno-images/raw/main/doc/set_up_you_account/checkoutbuilder.mp4)\n\n### Step 5: Get your API credentials\n\nTo complete the setup, you'll need to obtain your API credentials from the Yuno dashboard. These credentials are required for integrating Yuno into your application and are specific to the Sandbox environment.\n\n1. Navigate to the [Developers](https://dashboard.y.uno/developers) section in the dashboard sidebar\n2. Locate your API credentials in the Developer Tools section:\n   * Public API Key - Used for client-side SDK initialization\n   * Secret API Key - Used for server-side API calls\n\n[](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/writechoiceorg/yuno-images/main/doc/set_up_you_account/developer_V2.mp4)\n\nNow that you've completed the dashboard setup and obtained your API credentials, proceed to [Create your first payment](/docs/step-2-your-first-payment) to continue with the integration guide.\n\nUpdated 5 months ago\n\n---\n\nWhat’s Next\n\n* [Create Your First Payment](/docs/step-2-your-first-payment)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Step 1: Create your account on Yuno](#step-1-create-your-account-on-yuno)\n  + [Step 2: Set up your first connection](#step-2-set-up-your-first-connection)\n  + [Step 3: Set up routing for your new connection](#step-3-set-up-routing-for-your-new-connection)\n  + [Step 4: Enable the payment method in the checkout builder](#step-4-enable-the-payment-method-in-the-checkout-builder)\n  + [Step 5: Get your API credentials](#step-5-get-your-api-credentials)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/4e69b61-register_yuno_V2.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/4e69b61-register_yuno_V2.png", "alt_text": "Account creation process", "caption_blip": "the log page for the login login"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

A payment on Yuno can go through multiple processors via fallbacks, retries, or split routing, containing multiple transactions. You can check all transactions related to a payment in the [payment timeline](/docs/payments) on your Yuno dashboard.\n\nOn Yuno, transactions are divided into **primary** and **secondary** transactions. In addition, each transaction can have a different status depending on its processing stage.\n\n## Transaction types and statuses\n\n### Primary transactions\n\nPrimary transactions are related to an initiating transaction and can be one of three types:\n\n* **Purchase**: A standard sale transaction.\n* **Authorize**: A transaction used to authorize a payment amount to be captured at a later time.\n* **Verify**: A transaction to verify if the customer is using a valid payment method.\n\n### Secondary transactions\n\nSecondary transactions refer to additional transactions that affect the final outcome of the payment and primary transaction. The secondary transactions can be:\n\n* **Refund**: A refund made to the initial transaction, which can be full or partial.\n* **Cancel**: A cancellation of an initial authorization.\n* **Capture**: A capture of funds from an initial authorization transaction, which can be full or partial.\n* **Chargeback**: A dispute initiated by the customer regarding the initial transaction.\n* **3DS**: A 3D Secure (3DS) verification of an initial transaction.\n* **Fraud screening**: A fraud screening verification of an initial transaction. These are represented as `FRAUD_SCREENING` in your payments response.\n\nAll possible statuses for each transaction type are presented below.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/daccd29-concepts__transactions.png)\n\nRefer to the [Transactions API reference](/reference/transaction) for more detailed information on transaction status codes and messages.\n\nIn the [Payments](/docs/payments) section of your Yuno dashboard, you will be able to view and export all the information regarding your payments and transactions with Yuno.\n\nUpdated 3 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Payments](/docs/payments-1)[Tokens](/docs/tokens)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [What is a transaction?](#what-is-a-transaction)\n  + [Transaction types and statuses](#transaction-types-and-statuses)\n  + - [Primary transactions](#primary-transactions)\n    - [Secondary transactions](#secondary-transactions)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/daccd29-concepts__transactions.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/daccd29-concepts__transactions.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a diagram of a flow diagram"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

You can use the created Vaulted Token to identify the payment method in future payments.\n\nYuno's tokenization service and centralized vault enable you to handle recurring payments, fallbacks, and retries across processors without compromising UX. The following payment methods are available for enrollment in Yuno:\n\n## Available payment methods for enrollment\n\n| Payment Method | Type |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Cards** | `CARD` |\n| **Nupay** | `NU_PAY_ENROLLMENT` |\n| **PayPal** | `PAYPAL_ENROLLMENT` |\n| **Daviplata** | `DAVIPLATA_ENROLLMENT` |\n| **MercadoPago Wallet** | `WALLET_CONNECT` |\n| **dLocal Yape** | `YAPE_ENROLLMENT` |\n| **dLocal Smart PIX** | `SMART_PIX` |\n| **Astropay** | `ASTROPAY_ENROLLABLE` |\n| **Nequi**\\* | `NEQUI` |\n| **Bancolombia Tokenbox**\\* | `BANCOLOMBIA_TOKENBOX` |\n| **Adyen PIX Biométrico** | `PIX_BIOMETRICO` |\n\n(\\*) SDK only. Consult the [SDK documentation](/docs/yuno-sdks) for integration details.\n\n## Requirements\n\nBefore starting the enrollment process, you need to:\n\n* Access your [API credentials](/docs/developers-credentials) on the Yuno Dashboard, which are composed by:\n  + `public-api-key`\n  + `private-secret-key`\n  + `account_id`\n* [Set up your connections](/docs/connections) on your Yuno Dashboard account. Add a payment method that requires enrollment.\n* [Build a route](/docs/routing#configuring-the-dynamic-routing) for the payment method to define how it will be processed.\n* [Configure the checkout builder](/docs/checkout-builder) to make your connected payments available.\n\n## Steps summary\n\nTo enroll a payment method into a customer account, you will follow the steps listed below.\n\n1. [Create a customer](/reference/create-customer)\n2. [Create Customer Session](/reference/create-customer-session) (Exclusive for Checkout workflow)\n3. (Optional) Retrieve Payment Methods Available to Enroll - [Checkout workflow](/reference/retrieve-payment-methods-to-enroll-checkout)\n4. Enroll Payment Method [Checkout workflow](/reference/enroll-payment-method-checkout)/[Direct workflow](/reference/enroll-payment-method-api)\n5. Retrieve Payment Methods - [Direct workflow](/reference/retrieve-enrolled-payment-methods-api)\n\n## Enroll a payment method\n\n### Step 1: Create a customer\n\nUse the [Create Customer](/reference/create-customer) to register the customer info. You will need to provide personal customer information. In addition, you also need to supply the `merchant_customer_id`, a unique identifier for the customer used on your system.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Customer complementary information\n>\n> When creating a **Customer**, certain information is not required but can improve the user's payment experience if provided. Phone, billing address, and shipping address are examples of not mandatory data you can provide. If you add optional information, be aware of the required mandatory fields.\n\nAt the end of the create a customer process, you will receive an `id`, which identifies the user within the Yuno system. If you are enrolling a payment method for an existing user, who was previously created and already had an `id`, you can skip this step.\n\n### Step 2: Create a customer session\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Workflow Requirements\n>\n> The enrollment workflow varies by payment method type:\n>\n> * **Checkout workflow**: Requires customer session for most payment methods (Cards, Nupay, PayPal, Daviplata, dLocal methods, Astropay, Adyen PIX Biométrico)\n> * **Direct workflow**: Available for Cards only (PCI compliant merchants). Proceed directly to Step 3 using the customer `id` generated in Step 1.\n> * **SDK workflow**: Payment methods like Nequi and Bancolombia Tokenbox require SDK implementation. WALLET\\_CONNECT (MercadoPago) supports both SDK and Checkout workflows. Consult the [SDK documentation](/docs/sdk-overview) for details.\n\nAfter creating the customer, you will create a customer session to identify and store customers' information regarding payment preferences. Use the endpoint [Create Customer Session](/reference/create-customer-session) to perform the request. Notice that the `customer_id` required to perform the request is the `id` you received when creating the customer in [Step 1](/docs/enroll-payment-methods#step-1-create-a-customer).\n\nFrom the response of the endpoint [Create Customer Session](/reference/create-customer-session), you will receive the `customer_session`. It will be used in the payment method enrollment process.\n\n### Step 3: Retrieve payment methods to enroll\n\nThis is an **optional step** where you can list all available payment methods the customer can enroll in. If you know which payment method the user will enroll in, you can proceed to [Step 4](/docs/enroll-payment-methods#step-4-enroll-a-payment-method).\n\nTo list the available payment methods, you can use the Retrieve Payment Methods To Enroll endpoint. If you are using the [Checkout workflow](/reference/retrieve-payment-methods-to-enroll-checkout), you will inform the `customer_session` on the request. The Direct workflow does not currently support retrieving available payment methods to enroll.\n\nThe response to the endpoint **Retrieve Payment Methods To Enroll** will contain only the `payment_methods` parameter. It will provide an array of objects with all available payment methods to enroll. You will use the `type` information to enroll the payment method on the next step.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Available Payment Methods\n>\n> When you retrieve the payment methods available to enroll, only the ones which you have connected, created a route, and added to you checkout will be present on the response.\n\n### Step 4: Enroll a payment method\n\nAfter defining the payment method, you can perform the enrollment using one of the Enroll Payment Method endpoints:\n\n* [**Checkout workflow**](/reference/enroll-payment-method-checkout): Provide the `type` related to the chosen payment method to the parameter `payment_method_type`. Supported types include: `CARD`, `NU_PAY_ENROLLMENT`, `PAYPAL_ENROLLMENT`, `DAVIPLATA_ENROLLMENT`, `WALLET_CONNECT`, `YAPE_ENROLLMENT`, `SMART_PIX`, `ASTROPAY_ENROLLABLE` (with space), `PIX_BIOMETRICO`.\n* [**Direct workflow**](/reference/enroll-payment-method-api): Provide the `type` related to the chosen payment method to the parameter `type`. (Only available for `CARD` payment methods for PCI compliant merchants)\n* [**SDK workflow**](/docs/yuno-sdks): Payment methods like `NEQUI` and `BANCOLOMBIA_TOKENBOX` require SDK implementation. `WALLET_CONNECT` (MercadoPago) supports both SDK and Checkout workflows.\n\nThe user must be redirected to the payment provider page to complete the enrollment process. You will receive this URL in Step 5.\n\n### Step 5: Retrieve payment methods\n\nTo successfully enroll in the payment method, the customer must provide authorization on the payment provider page. To receive the URL, use one of the following endpoints depending on the workflow you are using:\n\n* Checkout workflow: The enrollment URL is provided directly in the enrollment response from Step 4. The URL to redirect the user will be available in the parameter `provider.redirect.init_url`.\n* Direct workflow: For the Direct workflow, as it is only available for card enrollments, you will receive the final status in the previous step.\n\nRedirect the user so they provide the required authorization. After the enrollment, you can proceed to the checkout session creation on the next step.\n\nTo confirm the enrollment, you can retrieve the enrolled payment methods. The `status` of the enrolled payment method should be `ENROLLED`.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Fingerprint\n>\n> When a credit card is enrolled, you will also find the `fingerprint` in the API response. It is a field that represents your customer's card throughout your organization.

It's based on the EMVCo secure payment standard, a global consortium comprising major card companies like Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/9411cdb-C2P_PAY.png)\n\n*Networks available in Yuno*: [MasterCard](https://www.mastercard.us/en-us/personal/ways-to-pay/click-to-pay.html)\n\n## Key Features and benefits:\n\n* **Ease of Use**: It enables consumers to make online purchases with a single click, eliminating the need to enter credit card details for each purchase manually.\n* **Enhanced Security**: Utilizes modern authentication standards to minimize fraud risk. This may include methods such as two-factor authentication or payment tokens.\n* **Consistent Across Various Sites**: Offers a similar payment experience across all websites that support this technology, meaning consumers don’t have to learn different processes for each online store.\n* **Integration with Card Brands**: Being backed by major card brands, \"Click to Pay\" is widely accepted and trusted.\n* **Mobile and Desktop Compatibility**: Designed to work across various devices, it facilitates online shopping on both desktops and mobile devices.\n\nThis feature enhances the customer experience and aligns with modern digital payment trends, potentially increasing conversion rates and customer loyalty. By incorporating \"Click to Pay,\" you can offer a seamless checkout experience, reducing friction and addressing security concerns in online transactions.\n\n## Integration\n\nTo integrate and start offering Click to Pay to your customers, follow these 3 simple steps:\n\n1. Create a [connection](https://dashboard.y.uno/connections) in the Yuno dashboard using your Click to Pay credentials.\n\n   ![](https://files.readme.io/c553dc8-C2P_connection.png)\n2. Define the payment method route in the [Routing](https://dashboard.y.uno/routing) section in order to be able to enable it in the Checkout Builder.\n\n   ![](https://files.readme.io/b22669d-C2P_Route.png)\n3. Enable Click to Pay in the [Checkout builder](https://dashboard.y.uno/checkout-builder).\n\n   ![](https://files.readme.io/24baf88-C2P_checkout.png)\n4. Define the Card route: Taking in consideration that Click to Pay is a wallet that stores credit card information, the **route** where you will need to define the providers for each scenario is the same as the **'Card' payment method**.\n\n## SDK integration\n\nThe Yuno iOS SDK supports Click to Pay with Passkey. The flow differs from standard card payments because the SDK returns the result by deeplink instead of via the usual delegate callbacks.\n\n### Handle the one-time token (OTT) and deeplink\n\nWhen a shopper completes the Click to Pay Passkey flow, the SDK sends the result through the deeplink URL instead of the `yunoCreatePayment(with token: String)` delegate method.\n\n#### 1. Close the external browser\n\nWhen your app receives the deeplink callback, immediately call `Yuno.receiveDeeplink` to let the SDK dismiss the external browser that was used for Passkey authentication.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nfunc application(_ app: UIApplication,\n                 open url: URL,\n                 options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {\n    Yuno.receiveDeeplink(url: url)\n\n    // Parse the URL to extract parameters\n\n    return true\n}\n```\n\n#### 2. Process the deeplink URL\n\nThe deeplink query string includes the information you need to continue:\n\n* `has_error`: Indicates an error occurred during the transaction. Handle this scenario in your app.\n* `one_time_token`: Present when the transaction succeeds. Use it to create the payment.\n\n#### 3. Create the payment\n\nIf the deeplink contains a `one_time_token`:\n\n1. Extract the `one_time_token`.\n2. Use it to create the payment with the [Create Payment endpoint](/reference/create-payment).\n3. After creating the payment, call `continuePayment` in the SDK to finalize the flow.\n\n> ⚠️\n>\n> ### Important\n>\n> The OTT never reaches `yunoCreatePayment(with token: String)` for Click to Pay Passkey. Always read the token from the deeplink URL.\n\nUpdated 12 days ago\n\n---\n\n[Integration Via Provider](/docs/integration-via-provider-google-pay)[NuPay](/docs/nupay)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Key Features and benefits:](#key-features-and-benefits)\n  + [Integration](#integration)\n  + [SDK integration](#sdk-integration)\n  + - [Handle the one-time token (OTT) and deeplink](#handle-the-one-time-token-ott-and-deeplink)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/9411cdb-C2P_PAY.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/9411cdb-C2P_PAY.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a screenshot of a credit card on a smartphone"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/c553dc8-C2P_connection.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/c553dc8-C2P_connection.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the settings page of the app"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/b22669d-C2P_Route.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/b22669d-C2P_Route.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a screenshote view of the user ' s profile"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/24baf88-C2P_checkout.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/24baf88-C2P_checkout.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the dashboard screen with the dashboard screen highlighted in purple"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

Direct integration offers full control over the payment flow and is ideal for merchants who need custom implementations or have existing payment systems.\n\nOur Apple Pay Direct integration supports one-time and recurring payments (useful for subscriptions and other regular transactions).\n\n> 📘\n>\n> Before implementing Apple Pay payments, ensure you have completed the [Apple Pay prerequisites](/docs/prerequisites-apple-pay).\n\n## Apple Pay overview\n\n1. Customer initiates payment on their iOS device\n2. Receive `payment_token` via Apple SDK\n3. [Create a payment](/reference/create-payment) with Yuno including the stringified token\n4. Yuno processes with your configured provider(s) and returns a response\n5. Monitor response status via [webhooks](/docs/webhooks)\n\n## One-time payments\n\nTo integrate a single transaction, such as an online purchase, use Yuno's API to [create a payment](/reference/create-payment). This requires you to obtain certain information from the Apple SDK's response, which is generated when the customer authorizes the payment.\n\n### Example Apple Pay response\n\nThe Apple Pay SDK returns an object like the example below, we call this response the `payment_token`.\n\nJSON\n\n```\n{\n  \"paymentMethod\": {\n    \"type\": \"credit\",\n    \"displayName\": \"Visa 3748\",\n    \"network\": \"Visa\"\n  },\n  \"paymentData\": {\n    \"data\": \"B5NSQI0TdXuLwqadBCL0yOwtik/rJx7v41xxE8rNSlFBTHR2W88iRck7a6bH9Kx/bBFsk2ZyinIEl2aXusHp22a0pSmuCUoPgbkFc1/D3PRAoWITfZkalBeuzMhHJGhhCe2wqOgMmjS2w97nN9vifb1cMrS3kOqpPPMihHVvhLYbwtNhh8lfeTOyL+RBXbdFScVTFCB1eFQ4znUFV79SHVK/SRjLxLawO1HGIO0VIUTj8uVgG4MmBrfQhDBD/P9a4lWypiNoyURHm7ubgcOEelbVDGlKSNDmYFD10i554b+7z8GXBtWdQc1zhWKcGOn8RsOYtxxdqzHEtJzcFsf92/rEhfpEThXjsLLMTmovGyQS30qM/qO2YgqduEID7IS+xOH/FXpplT5Yqur7/+FgEwcv2lGsa0K6kNMEUn1xSWc=\",\n    \"signature\": \"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\",\n    \"header\": {\n      \"publicKeyHash\": \"YK8kdoBXLGqBQKBtCZOl0DQTUHOWidRCxgOgf/1gBMM=\",\n      \"ephemeralPublicKey\": \"MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAEEVv32VVJYlg+E0zMsthvBaldJcH45NUWhVckme/CQYFtHf60FEdFtzwabOEMY3u1De+6e+IuBv53OxmWx+1w2w==\",\n      \"transactionId\": \"87a03c4cc1b242a25d74257d4bc990a6473b9866392850e584a9f680dcdf3d0f\"\n    },\n    \"version\": \"EC_v1\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Example one-time payment request\n\nHere is an example of a one-time Apple Pay payment request using Yuno's Direct API.

Initiated Transaction (CIT)\n\nWhen a customer authorizes the subscription and you have a response from the Apple SDK, use the stringified `payment_token` in Yuno's [create payment

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/sca-exemptions", "title": "SCA Exemptions", "content_markdown": "# SCA Exemptions\n\n# Understanding SCA Exemptions\n\nUnder the European Union's Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2), Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) is mandated for electronic payments to enhance security and reduce fraud. However, PSD2 provides specific scenarios—known as SCA exemptions—where transactions can bypass the standard authentication requirements. These exemptions are designed to streamline the payment process for low-risk transactions, improving the user experience without compromising security.\n\n# Challenge Request Indicator\n\nThe `strong_customer_authentication_exemptions` array enables merchants to specify their preference regarding the application of Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) exemptions during a transaction. By utilizing this field, merchants can request that certain transactions be exempted from the standard authentication challenges, thereby enhancing the customer experience and reducing friction during the payment process.\n\n## Allowed Values\n\nThe `strong_customer_authentication_exemptions` array accepts the following values, each corresponding to a specific SCA exemption:\n\n* **`LOW_VALUE`**: Indicates that the transaction amount is below the low-value threshold defined by PSD2 (typically under €30).\n  *Benefit*: Low-value transactions may be exempt from SCA, expediting the payment process for minor purchases.\n* **`TRANSACTION_RISK_ANALYSIS`**: Signifies that a Transaction Risk Analysis (TRA) has been conducted, and the transaction is deemed low-risk.\n  *Benefit*: Allows low-risk transactions to bypass SCA, improving conversion rates.\n* **`STRONG_CUSTOMER_AUTHENTICATION`**: Signifies that the authentication responsibility has been delegated to a trusted third party who has already performed SCA.\n  *Benefit*: Enables authorized third parties to manage authentication, reducing the need for additional challenges.\n* **`OUT_OF_SCOPE`**: Signifies that the authentication responsibility shouldn't be taken into account.\n* **`SECURE_CORPORATE`**: Indicates that the payment is made using a secure corporate card not assigned to an individual.\n  *Benefit*: Corporate payments may be exempt from SCA, facilitating seamless business transactions.\n* **`TRUSTED_BENEFICIARY`**: Denotes that the merchant has been added to the customer's list of trusted beneficiaries after an initial SCA.\n  *Benefit*: Subsequent payments to trusted merchants can be exempt from SCA, streamlining repeat purchases.\n* **`RECURRING_PAYMENT`**: Indicates that the transaction is a fixed-amount recurring payment to the same beneficiary.\n  *Benefit*: Recurring payments may be exempt from SCA after the initial authentication, enhancing the customer experience for subscription services.\n\n## Implementation Example\n\nThe Strong Customer Authentication exemptions come from either:\n\n* **[Recommended]** - The previous analysis of a fraud provider in your payment route:\n  + ![](https://files.readme.io/5e1b8247f3e9331bc2b87954083e493304b8dfcf2421666497dd28b8a7fe28b4-Screenshot_2025-06-09_at_9.35.29_AM.png)\n* Defining it when creating payment requests via API. Ensure that the selected value accurately reflects the nature of the transaction. For example:\n\nJSON\n\n```\n{\n  [...],\n  \"payment_method\": {\n        \"type\": \"CARD\",\n        \"detail\": {\n            \"card\": {\n                \"card_data\": {\n                    \"holder_name\": \"Paco\",\n                    \"number\": \"4871049999999910\",\n                    \"expiration_month\": 3,\n                    \"expiration_year\": 30,\n                    \"security_code\": \"737\"\n                },\n               \"three_d_secure\": {\n                        \"strong_customer_authentication_exemptions\": [\"LOW_VALUE\"]\n                    }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n[...]\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `strong_customer_authentication_exemptions` is set to LOW\\_VALUE, indicating that the transaction qualifies for the low-value payment exemption.\n\n### Considerations\n\n* *Issuer's Final Decision*: While merchants can request an exemption using the `strong_customer_authentication_exemptions` field, the card issuer has the final authority to accept or decline the exemption based on their risk assessment and compliance policies.\n* *Liability Implications*: Requesting an exemption may impact liability in cases of fraudulent transactions. It's essential to understand that if an exemption is granted, the liability shift associated with SCA may not apply.\n* *Regulatory Compliance*: Ensure that the use of this field aligns with regional regulations, such as PSD2 in Europe, and that your implementation adheres to the specific requirements and thresholds defined for each exemption type.\n\nBy effectively utilizing the `strong_customer_authentication_exemptions` field, merchants can optimize their payment processes, reduce friction for customers, and maintain compliance with regulatory standards.\n\nUpdated about 1 month ago\n\n---\n\n[Payment Details](/docs/payment-amount-details)[Cancel and Capture Flow](/docs/Cancel-and-capture-flow)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Understanding SCA Exemptions](#understanding-sca-exemptions)\n  + [Challenge Request Indicator](#challenge-request-indicator)\n  + - [Allowed Values](#allowed-values)\n    - [Implementation Example](#implementation-example)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/5e1b8247f3e9331bc2b87954083e493304b8dfcf2421666497dd28b8a7fe28b4-Screenshot_2025-06-09_at_9.35.29_AM.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/5e1b8247f3e9331bc2b87954083e493304b8dfcf2421666497dd28b8a7fe28b4-Screenshot_2025-06-09_at_9.35.29_AM.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a diagram showing the different types of the app"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}
{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/seamless-sdk-payment-web", "title": "Seamless SDK (Payment Web)", "content_markdown": "# Seamless SDK (Payment Web)\n\nFollow this step-by-step guide to implement and enable Yuno's Seamless Web SDK payment functionality in your application.\n\n> 👍\n>\n> ### Recommended SDK\n>\n> We recommend using the **Web Seamless SDK** for a smooth integration experience. This option provides a flexible payment solution with pre-built UI components and customization options.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Should I use Lite or Full Seamless SDK?\n>\n> Use the Full Seamless SDK for automatic payment method listing and separate display of payment buttons (like PayPal). The Lite Seamless SDK gives you more control over how payment methods are displayed and organized.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/bb2c987a467228d113d98035f453a459aedfb41554aad3eb49fc50fed8dbf0a0-Screenshot_2025-06-04_at_10.45.05_AM.png)\n\n## Step 1: Include the library in your project\n\nThe integration guide provides [three flexible methods](../docs/full-checkout-sdk#/choose-your-integration-method):\n\n1. Direct HTML script inclusion\n2. Dynamic JavaScript injection\n3. NPM module installation\n\nChoose the integration method that best suits your development workflow and technical requirements. After completing the SDK integration, you can proceed with the following steps to implement the Seamless functionality.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### TypeScript Library\n>\n> If you are using TypeScript, Yuno offers a [library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yuno-payments/sdk-web-types) that provides access to all available methods in the Yuno Web SDK.\n\n## Step 2: Initialize SDK with the public key\n\nInitialize the Yuno SDK in your JavaScript application by providing a valid `PUBLIC_API_KEY`:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst yuno = await Yuno.initialize(PUBLIC_API_KEY);\n```\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Credentials\n>\n> See the credentials page for more information: [https://docs.y.uno/reference/authentication](/reference/authentication)\n\n## Step 3: Create a checkout session\n\nTo initialize the payment flow, create a new `checkout_session` using the [Create checkout session](/reference/create-checkout-session) endpoint.\n\n* First, [create a customer](/reference/create-customer) or retrieve an existing customer ID\n* Include it when creating the `checkout_session`\n\n### Key Parameters\n\n| Parameter | Required | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `amount` | Yes | The primary transaction amount object containing `currency` (ISO 4217 code) and `value` (numeric amount in that currency). |\n| `alternative_amount` | No | An alternative currency representation of the transaction amount with the same structure as `amount` (`currency` and `value`). Useful for multi-currency scenarios, such as displaying prices to customers in their preferred currency (e.g., USD) while processing the payment in the local currency (e.g., COP). |\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### `onPaymentMethodSelect` Event\n>\n> For all APMs, including Google Pay, Apple Pay, and PayPal, `onPaymentMethodSelected` is triggered as soon as the customer chooses the payment method (before the payment flow begins). Define `onPaymentMethodSelected` in `startSeamlessCheckout` before `mountSeamlessCheckout`.\n\n## Step 4: Start the checkout process\n\nUse the configuration below to provide a seamless and user-friendly payment experience for your customers:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyuno.startSeamlessCheckout({\n  checkoutSession: \"438413b7-4921-41e4-b8f3-28a5a0141638\",\n  elementSelector: \"#root\",\n  countryCode: \"US\",\n  language: \"en\",\n  showLoading: true,\n  issuersFormEnable: true,\n  showPaymentStatus: true,\n  onLoading: (args) => console.log(args),\n  renderMode: {\n    type: \"modal\",\n    elementSelector: {\n      apmForm: \"#form-element\",\n      actionForm: \"#action-form-element\",\n    },\n  },\n  card: {\n    type: \"extends\",\n    styles: \"\",\n    cardSaveEnable: false,\n    texts: {},\n  },\n  texts: {},\n  async yunoCreatePayment(oneTimeToken, tokenWithInformation) {\n    await createPayment({ oneTimeToken, checkoutSession });\n    yuno.continuePayment({ showPaymentStatus: true });\n  },\n  yunoPaymentMethodSelected(data) {\n    console.log(\"Payment method selected:\", data);\n  },\n  yunoPaymentResult(data) {\n    console.log(\"Payment result:\", data);\n    yuno.hideLoader();\n  },\n  yunoError(error, data) {\n    console.error(\"An error occurred:\", error);\n    yuno.hideLoader();\n  },\n});\n```\n\nWhen using `startSeamlessCheckout`, specify the callbacks to handle payments. You can also customize the checkout interface using the `texts` objects.\n\n### Parameters\n\nConfigure the seamless checkout with the following options:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `checkoutSession` | Refers to the current payment's [checkout session](/reference/create-checkout-session). Example: `438413b7-4921-41e4-b8f3-28a5a0141638`. |\n| `elementSelector` | The HTML element where the checkout will be rendered. |\n| `countryCode` | This parameter specifies the country for which the payment process is being set up. Use an `ENUM` value representing the desired country code. You can find the full list of supported countries and their corresponding codes on the [Country Coverage](/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk) page. |\n| `language` | Defines the language to be used in the payment forms. You can set it to one of the available language options:  * es (Spanish) * en (English) * pt (Portuguese) * fil (Filipino) * id (Indonesian) * ms (Malay) * th (Thai) |\n| `showLoading` | Controls the visibility of the Yuno loading/spinner page during the payment process. Default: `true`. |\n| `onLoading` | Required to receive notifications about server calls or loading events during the payment process. |\n| `issuersFormEnable` | Enables the issuer's form (e.g., a list of banks). Default: `true`. |\n| `showPaymentStatus` | Shows the Yuno Payment Status page, which is useful when continuing a payment. Default: `true`. |\n| `showPayButton` | Controls the visibility of the pay button in the customer or card form. Default: `true`. |\n| `renderMode` | Specify how and where the forms will be rendered. The options available are: |\n|  | ▪️ `type: modal` (default) |\n|  | ▪️ `type: element` - If you select `element`, you must inform the `elementSelector` to specify where the form should be rendered. |\n| `card` | Defines the configuration for the card form. It contains settings like render mode, custom styles, and save card option. |\n| `texts` | Allows you to set custom button texts for card and non-card payment forms. |\n| `yunoCreatePayment` | Placeholder function for creating a payment. This function will not be called but should be implemented. |\n| `yunoPaymentMethodSelected` | Callback invoked when a payment method is selected, along with the method's type and name. |\n| `yunoPaymentResult` | Callback called after the payment is completed, with the payment status (e.g., `SUCCEEDED`, `ERROR`). |\n| `yunoError` | Callback invoked when there is an error in the payment process. Receives error type and optional additional data. |\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Customer and Merchant-Initiated Transactions\n>\n> Payments can be initiated by the customer (CIT) or by the merchant (MIT). You find more information about their characteristics in [Stored credentials](../docs/stored-credentials).\n>\n> The step-by-step on this page refers to a customer-initiated transaction without the recurrence option. Typically, it's used in one-time online purchases, in-store purchases, ATM withdrawals, etc.\n\n## Step 5: Mount the SDK\n\nTo present the checkout process based on the selected payment method, use the `yuno.mountSeamlessCheckout()` function. This step ensures the SDK is properly mounted on your chosen HTML element.\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyuno.mountSeamlessCheckout({\n  paymentMethodType: PAYMENT_METHOD_TYPE,\n  vaultedToken: VAULTED_TOKEN,\n});\n```\n\nSee the [Payment type](/reference/payment-type-list) page to view the complete list of payment method types you can use when mounting the SDK.\n\nThe `vaultedToken` is optional. It represents a previously enrolled payment method. If you provide the `vaultedToken`, the user will not be required to provide the payment information again since it was provided in a previous transaction.\n\nAfter mounting, you must start the checkout flow by calling `yuno.startPayment()`. If you skip this call, the payment form will not open.\n\n## Step 6: Start the payment flow (Required)\n\nCall `yuno.startPayment()` immediately after `yuno.mountSeamlessCheckout()` to open the selected payment method UI:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyuno.mountSeamlessCheckout({\n  paymentMethodType: PAYMENT_METHOD_TYPE,\n  vaultedToken: VAULTED_TOKEN,\n});\n\nyuno.startPayment();\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can trigger the start from a user action such as a button click:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst payButton = document.querySelector('#button-pay');\npayButton.addEventListener('click', () => {\n  yuno.startPayment();\n});\n```\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Demo App\n>\n> In addition to the code examples provided, you can access the [Demo App](/docs/demo-app) for a complete implementation of Yuno SDKs.

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/basic-concepts", "title": "Basic Concepts", "content_markdown": "# Basic Concepts\n\nTo understand how Yuno operates, you need to grasp some fundamental concepts about its architecture. This guide covers the essential elements required for integration:\n\n* **Sessions**: The most basic component of a transaction. A session begins when a user visits your checkout page and views the available payment methods. It contains all relevant checkout information, including available payment methods and tokenized options for returning users.\n* **Payments**: A payment occurs when a user initiates a payment action during a checkout session.\n* **Transactions**: These represent operations related to payments, such as purchases or refunds, processed through one or more connections.\n\n![Transactions and Sessions](https://github.com/writechoiceorg/yuno-images/blob/main/doc/concepts/transactions_sessions.png?raw=true)\n\n## Concept list\n\nFor a deeper understanding of each concept related to Yuno's system, visit the respective pages:\n\n[#### Customers](/docs/customers)[#### Sessions](/docs/sessions)[#### Payments](/docs/payments-1)[#### Transactions](/docs/transactions)[#### Tokens](/docs/tokens)[#### Payment Methods](/docs/payment-methods)[#### Fraud Prevention](/docs/fraud)[#### 3DS](/docs/3ds-1)\n\nUpdated 5 months ago\n\n---\n\n[How the Yuno Payment Process Works](/docs/how-yuno-payment-flow-works)[Customers](/docs/customers)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Concept list](#concept-list)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://github.com/writechoiceorg/yuno-images/blob/main/doc/concepts/transactions_sessions.png?raw=true", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/transactions_sessions.png", "alt_text": "Transactions and Sessions", "caption_blip": "a flow diagram with several different types of flow"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}
{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/full-sdk-implementation", "title": "Full SDK (Web) Implementation", "content_markdown": "# Full SDK (Web) Implementation\n\nThis page provides a step-by-step guide to implement and enable Yuno's Full Web SDK functionality in your application.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Changelog Reference:\n>\n> This guide covers the current SDK version. For details on previous versions, see the [changelog](/changelog/web-sdk-v13-changelog).\n\n## Step 1: Include the library in your project\n\nAdd the following script tag to your HTML file to include the Yuno Web SDK:\n\nHTML\n\n```\n<script src=\"https://cdn.yuno.com/sdk-web/latest/yuno-sdk-web.js\"></script>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can install it via npm:\n\nBash\n\n```\nnpm install @yuno-payments/sdk-web\n```\n\nAfter completing the SDK integration, proceed with the following steps to implement the full checkout functionality.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### TypeScript Library\n>\n> If you are using TypeScript, Yuno provides a [library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yuno-payments/sdk-web-types) to see all methods available in the Yuno Web SDK.\n\n## Step 2: Initialize SDK with the public key\n\nCreate an instance of the `Yuno` class by providing a valid `PUBLIC_API_KEY`. See the [credentials](../docs/developers-credentials) page for more information.\n\nInitialize the SDK with your public API key:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst yuno = await Yuno.initialize(PUBLIC_API_KEY);\n```\n\n## Step 3: Start the checkout process\n\nUse the `yuno.startCheckout` function to start the checkout process with the necessary parameters.\n\nSee the [Parameters table below](#parameters) for all the options you can use with `startCheckout`.\n\nFor further customization or advanced/optional settings, see the [Complementary Features](#complementary-features) section.\n\n### Parameters\n\nThe following table lists all the available parameters for the `startCheckout` method with descriptions:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `checkoutSession` | Refers to the current payment's [checkout session](/reference/create-checkout-session). Example: `'438413b7-4921-41e4-b8f3-28a5a0141638'` |\n| `elementSelector` | The element where the SDK will be mounted. |\n| `countryCode` | This parameter specifies the country for which the payment process is being set up. Use an `ENUM` value representing the desired country code. You can find the full list of supported countries and their corresponding codes on the [Country Coverage](/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk) page. |\n| `language` | Defines the language to be used in the payment forms. You can set it to one of the available language options:  * es (Spanish) * en (English) * pt (Portuguese) * fil (Filipino) * id (Indonesian) * ms (Malay) * th (Thai) |\n| `onLoading` | Required to receive notifications about server calls or loading events during the payment process. |\n| `showLoading` | Control the visibility of the Yuno loading/spinner page during the payment process. By default, it's `true`. |\n| `issuersFormEnable` | Enables the issuer's form. By default, it's `true`. |\n| `showPaymentStatus` | Shows the Yuno Payment Status page. You can use this option when continuing a payment as well. By default, it's `true`. |\n| `card.isCreditCardProcessingOnly` | Enables you to ensure that all card transactions are processed as credit only. This option is helpful in markets where cards can act as both credit and debit. To enable, set the `isCreditCardProcessingOnly` to `true` to ensure that all card transactions are processed as credit. This parameter is not required. |\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyuno.startCheckout({\n  checkoutSession: \"438413b7-4921-41e4-b8f3-28a5a0141638\",\n  elementSelector: \"#root\",\n  countryCode: \"FR\",\n  language: \"fr\",\n  showLoading: true,\n  issuersFormEnable: true,\n  showPaymentStatus: true,\n  card: {\n    isCreditCardProcessingOnly: true,\n    onChange: ({ error, data }) => {\n      if (error) {\n        console.log('Card form error:', error);\n      } else {\n        console.log('Card form data:', data);\n      }\n    },\n  },\n  onLoading: (args) => {\n    console.log(args);\n  },\n  yunoPaymentMethodSelected: () => {\n    console.log(\"Payment method selected\");\n  },\n  yunoPaymentResult: (status) => {\n    console.log(\"Payment result:\", status);\n  },\n  yunoError: (message, data) => {\n    console.error(\"Payment error:\", message, data);\n  },\n  async yunoCreatePayment(oneTimeToken) {\n    await createPayment({ oneTimeToken, checkoutSession });\n    yuno.continuePayment({ showPaymentStatus: true });\n  },\n});\n```\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Rendering Mode\n>\n> By default, Yuno SDK renders as a modal. However, you can specify the element where the SDK will render. For additional information, access [Render mode](#render-mode) under the complementary features page.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### `onPaymentMethodSelected` Event\n>\n> For all APMs, including Google Pay, Apple Pay, and PayPal, `onPaymentMethodSelected` is triggered as soon as the customer chooses the payment method (before the payment flow begins). Define `onPaymentMethodSelected` in `startCheckout` before `mountCheckout`.\n\n## Step 4: Mount the SDK\n\nDisplay the payment methods:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyuno.mountCheckout();\n```\n\nMount with a default payment method selected:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyuno.mountCheckout({\n  paymentMethodType: PAYMENT_METHOD_TYPE,\n  vaultedToken: VAULTED_TOKEN,\n});\n```\n\n## Step 5: Initiate the payment process\n\nCall `yuno.startPayment()` to initiate the payment flow after the user selects a payment method:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst PayButton = document.querySelector(\"#button-pay\");\n\nPayButton.addEventListener(\"click\", () => {\n  yuno.startPayment();\n});\n```\n\n## Step 6: Get the OTT (one-time token)\n\nAfter the customer fills out the requested data in Yuno's payment forms, the SDK provides the one-time token. The configuration function `yuno.CreatePayment(oneTimeToken)` is then triggered with the one-time token.\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyunoCreatePayment(oneTimeToken);\n```\n\nYou can also use `tokenWithInformation` to receive additional information provided by the customer in the checkout, such as installments or document type/number:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyunoCreatePayment(oneTimeToken, tokenWithInformation);\n```\n\n> ❗️\n>\n> ### Loader Management\n>\n> The merchant is responsible for managing the loader. Yuno provides a default loader option, but merchants may implement their own loader if preferred. In that case, they are responsible for making the necessary configurations.\n\n## Step 7: Create the Payment\n\nAfter completing the previous steps, proceed to create a payment. Back-to-back payment creation must be performed using the [Create Payment endpoint](/reference/create-payment). The merchant's backend should call this endpoint to create the payment in Yuno using the one-time token and checkout session.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Complete the Integration\n>\n> After Step 7, you have successfully implemented the basic payment flow. To test your integration, create a test payment using the checkout session and one-time token. For additional features and advanced configurations, see the [Complementary Features](#complementary-features) section below.\n\n> ❗️\n>\n> ### ContinuePaymentmethod\n>\n> After creating a payment, Yuno **requires** you to integrate the `continuePayment` method from the SDK. This is necessary because some asynchronous payment methods require additional customer actions to complete the process. The API response will indicate this scenario by setting the `sdk_action_required` field to true. When this occurs, you must call `yuno.continuePayment()`, which will automatically present the necessary screens to the customer, allowing them to complete the payment flow without requiring you to handle each case manually.\n\n## `continuePayment` return value or null\n\nFor payment methods that require merchant-side action (e.g., when the payment provider requires a redirect URL in a webview), the `await yuno.continuePayment()` method returns either an object with the following structure or null:\n\nTypeScript\n\n```\n{\n  action: 'REDIRECT_URL'\n  type: string\n  redirect: {\n    init_url: string\n    success_url: string\n    error_url: string\n  }\n} | null\n```\n\nWhen the method returns an object, you can handle your application's payment flows that require custom redirect handling. When it returns null, no additional merchant-side action is needed.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Demo App\n>\n> In addition to the code examples provided, you can access the [Demo App](/docs/demo-app) for a complete implementation of Yuno SDKs. The demo app includes working examples of all Yuno SDKs and can be cloned from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-web).\n\n## Complementary features\n\nYuno Web SDK provides additional services and configurations you can use to improve customers' experience:\n\n* [Form loader](#form-loader)\n* [Render mode](#render-mode)\n* [Card form configurations](#card-form-configurations) \n  + [Save Card for future payments](#save-card-for-future-payments)\n  + [Rendering modes](#rendering-modes)\n  + [Text payment form buttons](#text-payment-form-buttons)\n  + [Persist credit card form to retry payments](#persist-credit-card-form-to-retry-payments)\n  + [Hide Pay button](#hide-pay-button)\n\n### Form loader\n\nControl the use of the loader:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `showLoading` | You can hide or show the Yuno loading/spinner page. Enabling this option ensures that the loading component remains displayed until either the `hideLoader()` or `continuePayment()` function is called. The default value is true. |\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyuno.startCheckout({\n  showLoading: true,\n});\n```\n\n### Issuer's form\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `issuersFormEnable` | Configure the SDK to enable the issuer's form (bank list): |\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyuno.startCheckout({\n  issuersFormEnable: true,\n});\n```\n\n### Render mode\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `renderMode` | This optional parameter determines the mode in which the payment forms will be displayed. |\n|  | * `type`: can be one of `modal` or `element`. |\n|  | * `elementSelector`: Element where the form will be rendered. Only required if `type` is `element`. |\n| `elementSelector` | Required only if the type is `element`. Specifies the HTML elements where you want to mount the Yuno SDK. You can specify the elements using one of the following options: |\n|  | * **String (Deprecated)**: Provide the ID or selector of the element where the SDK should be mounted. |\n|  | * **Object**: Specify the elements for mounting the APM and action forms. You need to provide the element for the `apmForm`, which is where the APM is displayed, and the element for the `actionForm`, where the Continue Payment button appears. This button triggers a modal that shows the steps to complete a payment with a provider. For example, with PIX, it displays a QR code. |\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyuno.startCheckout({\n  renderMode: {\n    type: \"modal\",\n    elementSelector: {\n      apmForm: \"#form-element\",\n      actionForm: \"#action-form-element\",\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### Card form configurations\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `card` | Define specific settings for the credit card form: |\n|  | - **`type`**: `step` or `extends` |\n|  | - **`styles`**: You can edit card form styles. Only you should write css, then it will be injected into the iframe. |\n|  | - **`cardSaveEnable`**: Show checkbox for save/enroll card. The default value is false. |\n|  | - **`texts`**: Custom texts in the Card forms buttons. |\n|  | - **`onChange`**: Callback function triggered when card information state changes. This method is called whenever a card-related event occurs, such as during data fetching (loading), after completion, when a network is selected (mastercard-cartes bancaires, visa-cartes bancaires, etc), or when the card form is reset. Receives `{error, data}` where `data` contains card IIN information and installment options. This works the same as secure fields `options.onChange` method. |\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyuno.startCheckout({\n  card: {\n    type: \"extends\",\n    styles: \"\",\n    cardSaveEnable: false,\n    texts: {},\n    isCreditCardProcessingOnly: true,\n    onChange: ({ error, data }) => {\n      if (error) {\n        console.log('Card form error:', error);\n      } else {\n        console.log('Card form data:', data);\n      }\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### Save card for future payments\n\nYou can display a checkbox for saving or enrolling cards using `cardSaveEnable: true`. The following examples show the checkbox for both card form renders:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/37b2e00b0c6a3d31bceb42b26b1b433c8d30e61d947a93298dd90c466bde004b-complementary-features.png)\n\n### Rendering modes\n\nThe following screenshots show the difference between:\n\n* Render modes `modal` and `elements` for the payment method list\n* Render modes `step` and `extends` for the credit card form\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/b56fe6dfdebaee158495dea86d5269d865fae2dfcb81eb8b34879f9e5e737f0e-caracteristicas_Complemetarias_web_1.png)\n\nYou can also choose one of the render options for the card form, `step` and `extends`:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/08654f8fa7b638641cb1b9f5b882a75537a9e449fff4960cf560c1ec5b3efb74-caracteristicas_Complemetarias_web_2.png)\n\n### Text payment form buttons\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `texts` | Provide custom text for payment form buttons to match your application's language or branding: |\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyuno.startCheckout({\n  texts: {\n    customerForm?: {\n      submitButton?: string;\n    }\n    paymentOtp?: {\n      sendOtpButton?: string;\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n### Persist credit card form to retry payments\n\nIf a transaction is rejected, you can use the credit card form to retry a payment after the customer has entered the credit card details. To do this:\n\n1. Add the following parameter while initializing the SDK to persist the credit card form after the one-time use token is created:\n\n   JavaScript\n\n   ```\n   yuno.startCheckout({\n     automaticallyUnmount: false,\n   });\n   ```\n2. If the transaction is rejected:\n   1. Execute the method `yuno.notifyError()` to delete the previously entered CVV for the first transaction\n   2. Create a new checkout session and update the SDK with the new one by executing `yuno.updateCheckoutSession(checkoutsession)`\n3. Continue with the new checkout and one-time use token with the regular payment flow.\n\n### Hide Pay button\n\nYou can hide the Pay button when presenting the card or customer data form. Set `showPayButton` to `false` when starting the checkout with the `startCheckout` function:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyuno.startCheckout({\n  showPayButton: false,\n});\n```\n\nThe following images show examples of the Customer Data Form with and without the Pay button:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/873a709f1c3dce3c3dcc13dd4fd3cc9b5a8ecdf812c3b631f3cf8700177cc5cf-Card_boton.png)\n\nThe following images show examples of the Card Form with and without the Pay button:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/b8b5e51ab3f5907786b802cb782a71e043f4ec18475b6e5b6d4dd052c6dc4e37-Card_boton_1.png)\n\nIf you hide the Pay button, you need to start the one-time token creation through your code. To create the one-time token and continue the payment in your backend, call the `submitOneTimeTokenForm` function:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyuno.submitOneTimeTokenForm();\n```\n\n#### Optional initialization `options` parameter\n\nThis optional feature is intended for advanced use cases where you need to customize how device identification is handled via cookies.\n\nStarting from Yuno SDK v1.2, the `Yuno.initialize` function supports a new optional parameter called `options`. This allows for advanced configuration such as customizing the cookie name used for device identification.\n\n### Initialization options\n\nThe updated function signature is:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst yuno = await Yuno.initialize(publicApiKey, applicationSession, options);\n```\n\n* `publicApiKey` (`string`): Your public API key.\n* `applicationSession` (`string | undefined`): Optional session ID.\n  > **Recommendation:** Leave this as `undefined` so the SDK can generate and manage its own session internally. Only set this if you require a custom session management strategy.\n* `options` (`object | undefined`): Optional object for advanced configuration.\n\n### Options structure\n\nThe `options` object supports the following structure:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst options = {\n  cookies: {\n    deviceId: {\n      name: \"customCookieName\",\n    },\n  },\n};\n```\n\n> If `deviceId.name` is not specified, the SDK defaults to `\"yuno\"` as the cookie name.\n\n### Implementation example\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst publicApiKey = \"your-public-api-key\";\nconst options = {\n  cookies: {\n    deviceId: {\n      name: \"custom-device-id\",\n    },\n  },\n};\n\nconst yuno = await Yuno.initialize(publicApiKey, undefined, options);\n```\n\n## What's next?\n\nLearn about the additional configurations from the Full SDK by accessing [Complementary Features](/docs/complementary-features-full-sdk).

This option provides a flexible payment solution with pre-built UI components and customization options.\n\nThis SDK is ideal for merchants who:\n\n* Want control over the payment flow while leveraging pre-built UI components\n* Need to customize the payment experience while maintaining PCI compliance\n* Require a balance between implementation speed and customization\n\nThe Seamless SDK includes features like:\n\n* Pre-built payment UI components with customization options\n* Multiple payment method support\n* Advanced payment status handling\n* Comprehensive error management\n\nFor merchants requiring complete UI control or more advanced features, consider using our [Full SDK](/docs/full-checkout-android) instead.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/bb2c987a467228d113d98035f453a459aedfb41554aad3eb49fc50fed8dbf0a0-Screenshot_2025-06-04_at_10.45.05_AM.png)\n\n## Requirements\n\nBefore starting the Yuno Android SDK integration, ensure your project meets the [technical requirements](/docs/requirements-android). Also, ensure the following prerequisites are in place:\n\n* You must have an active Yuno account.\n* You need your Yuno API credentials (`account_id`, `public-api-key`, and `private-secret-key`), which you can obtain from the [Developers section of the Yuno dashboard](../docs/developers-credentials). These credentials are required to authenticate requests to the Yuno API. The API is used to:\n  + Create a `customer`, which is required before initiating payments\n  + Create a `checkout_session`, which initializes the payment flow\n  + Create the payment associated with the session\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Verify SDK Version\n>\n> See the [Release notes](release-notes-android-sdk) or the [Yuno Android SDK repository](https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-android) to verify the current SDK version available.\n\n## Step 1: Create a customer\n\nCreate a customer using the [Create customer endpoint](/reference/create-customer) before initiating payments. This step is required to:\n\n* Identify the person making the payment\n* Enable saved card functionality (if enabled)\n* Track payment history\n\nThe customer ID returned from this endpoint will be used when creating the `checkout_session`.\n\n## Step 2: Create a checkout session\n\nCreate a new `checkout_session` using the [Create checkout session](/reference/create-checkout-session) endpoint to initialize the payment flow. Make sure to:\n\n* Include the customer ID obtained from the previous step\n* Store the returned `checkout_session` ID for use in Step 6 of the integration\n\n### Key Parameters\n\n| Parameter | Required | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `amount` | Yes | The primary transaction amount object containing `currency` (ISO 4217 code) and `value` (numeric amount in that currency). |\n| `alternative_amount` | No | An alternative currency representation of the transaction amount with the same structure as `amount` (`currency` and `value`). Useful for multi-currency scenarios, such as displaying prices to customers in their preferred currency (e.g., USD) while processing the payment in the local currency (e.g., COP). |\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Checkout Session Usage\n>\n> The `checkout_session` is unique for each payment attempt and cannot be reused.\n\n## Step 3: Add SDK to your project\n\nAdd the repository source:\n\nGroovy\n\n```\nmaven { url \"https://yunopayments.jfrog.io/artifactory/snapshots-libs-release\" }\n```\n\nInclude the following code in the `build.gradle` file to add the Yuno SDK dependency to the application:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'com.yuno.payments:android-sdk:{last_version}'\n}\n```\n\n## Step 4: Configure permissions\n\nThe Yuno SDK requires network permissions. Ensure the `INTERNET` permission is included in your `AndroidManifest.xml`:\n\nXML\n\n```\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" />\n```\n\n## Step 5: Initialize SDK\n\nRetrieve your public API keys from the [Yuno dashboard](https://dashboard.y.uno/).\n\nIf you haven't implemented a custom application, create one. In the `onCreate()` method of your application class, call the initialize function (`Yuno.initialize`):\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nclass CustomApplication : Application() {\n    override fun onCreate() {\n        super.onCreate()\n        Yuno.initialize(\n            this,\n            PUBLIC_API_KEY,\n            config = YunoConfig()\n        )\n    }\n}\n```\n\nUse the `YunoConfig` data class to set additional configurations for the SDK. The following table lists and describes the customization options:\n\n| Option | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| **cardFlow** | Defines the card form flow. The default option is `CardFormType.ONE_STEP`. Check the section [Render options](#render-options) for more information. |\n| **saveCardEnabled** | Enables the save card checkbox for card flows. Check the [Save card](#save-card-for-future-payments) section for more information. |\n| **language** | Defines the language to be used in the payment forms. You can set it to one of the available language options:  * es (Spanish) * en (English) * pt (Portuguese) * fil (Filipino) * id (Indonesian) * ms (Malay) * th (Thai) * zh-TW (Chinese (Traditional, Taiwan)) * zh-CN (Chinese (Simplified, China)) * vi (Vietnamese) * fr (French) * pl (Polish) * it (Italian) * de (German) * ru (Russian) * tr (Turkish) * nl (Dutch) * sv (Swedish) * ko (Korean) * ja (Japanese) |\n| **styles** | Enables SDK-wide UI customization. Use it to define global visual styles like font family and button appearance (color, padding, radius, typography) through a `YunoStyles` object. For more information, check the [`styles`](../docs/full-checkout-android#styles) section. |\n\nThe following code block shows an example of `YunoConfig`:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\ndata class YunoConfig(\n    val cardFlow: CardFormType = CardFormType.ONE_STEP,\n    val saveCardEnabled: Boolean = false,\n    val language: YunoLanguage? = null,\n  \tval styles: YunoStyles? = null \n)\n```\n\n## Step 6: Start checkout\n\nCall the `startCheckout` method in the `onCreate()` function of the activity that integrates the SDK to initiate a new payment process with the Seamless SDK:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nstartCheckout(\n  checkoutSession: \"checkout_session\",\n  country_code: \"US\",\n  callbackPaymentState: ((String?) -> Unit)?,\n  merchantSessionId: String? = null\n)\n```\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `checkoutSession` | The `checkout_session` is related to the payment. |\n| `country_code` | Country code where the payment is performed. See [Country coverage](/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk) for a complete list of supported countries and their codes. |\n| `callbackPaymentState` | A function that returns the current payment process. Optional if you don't need the result. |\n| `merchantSessionId` | Optional identifier for merchant session tracking. Default is null. |\n\nThe possible payment states returned by `callbackPaymentState` are:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nconst val PAYMENT_STATE_SUCCEEDED = \"SUCCEEDED\"\nconst val PAYMENT_STATE_FAIL = \"FAIL\"\nconst val PAYMENT_STATE_PROCESSING = \"PROCESSING\"\nconst val PAYMENT_STATE_REJECT = \"REJECT\"\nconst val PAYMENT_STATE_INTERNAL_ERROR = \"INTERNAL_ERROR\"\nconst val PAYMENT_STATE_STATE_CANCELED_BY_USER = \"CANCELED\"\n```\n\nThe following table provides additional information about the possible states:\n\n| **State** | **Description** | **Additional action required** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `SUCCEEDED` | The transaction or payment process was successfully completed without any errors. | No. |\n| `FAIL` | The transaction failed due to errors such as data validation issues, server connection failures, or technical/network problems. | Yes. Investigate the cause of failure (validation, network, server) and take corrective measures. |\n| `PROCESSING` | The transaction is currently in progress, awaiting approval or verification. | No. |\n| `REJECT` | The transaction was rejected due to reasons like insufficient funds or suspected fraudulent activity. | Yes. Inform the user of the rejection, provide the reason if possible, and suggest actions. |\n| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | An unexpected internal error occurred within the system handling the payment process. | Yes. Requires technical intervention to review the system, fix internal issues, and retry or inform the user. |\n| `CANCELED` | The user voluntarily canceled the transaction or abandoned the payment process. | No. |\n\n## Step 7: Get payment one-time token (OTT)\n\nCall the method `startPaymentSeamlessLite` to start a payment process:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nstartPaymentSeamlessLite(\n    paymentSelected: PaymentSelected,\n    callbackPaymentState: ((String?) -> Unit)?,\n    showPaymentStatus: Boolean,\n)\n```\n\nThe following table describes the parameters to start the payment:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `paymentSelected` | Specifies the payment method, either through a vaulted token or a selected payment type. |\n| `callbackPaymentState` | This is an optional parameter. This function handles the state updates. |\n| `showPaymentStatus` | This is an optional parameter. When `true`, displays the SDK's default result screen. |\n\nYou will receive the payment status via `callbackPaymentState`, which will indicate whether the payment was successful or if an issue occurred.\n\n## Step 8: Create payment\n\nCall the method `startPaymentSeamlessLite` with the selected payment method to complete the payment process:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nstartPaymentSeamlessLite(\n    paymentSelected: PaymentSelected,\n    callbackPaymentState: ((String?) -> Unit)?,\n    showPaymentStatus: Boolean,\n)\n```\n\n## Complementary features\n\nYuno Android SDK provides additional services and configurations you can use to improve customers' experience. Use the [SDK customization](/docs/sdk-customizations-android) to change the SDK appearance to match your brand or to configure the loader.\n\n### `styles`\n\nWith the `styles` customization option, you can define global visual styles through a `YunoStyles` object. It lets you apply consistent branding across the SDK by customizing button appearance and typography.\n\nKotlin\n\n```\ndata class YunoStyles(\n    val buttonStyles: YunoButtonStyles? = null,\n    val fontFamily: FontFamily? = null\n)\n```\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `buttonStyles` | Customizes the primary buttons displayed in the SDK. |\n| `fontFamily` | Sets the font family used across all SDK text elements. |\n\nThe `YunoButtonStyles` object lets you define specific settings for button appearance:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\ndata class YunoButtonStyles(\n    val backgroundColor: Color? = null,\n    val contentColor: Color? = null,\n    val cornerRadius: Dp? = null,\n    val elevation: Dp? = null,\n    val padding: Dp? = null,\n    val fontFamily: FontFamily? = null,\n    val fontSize: TextUnit? = null,\n    val fontStyle: FontStyle? = null\n)\n```\n\nUse the `YunoConfig` data class, described in Step 5, to use the `styles` customization option.\n\n### Loader\n\nThe loader functionality is controlled through the `keepLoader` parameter in the `YunoConfig` data class, which is documented inline in the SDK configuration section above.\n\n### Save card for future payments\n\nYou can also display a checkbox to save or enroll cards using `cardSaveEnable: true`. The following examples show the checkbox for both card form renders:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/1c3d62f0307923298b22f18a1e58f86f8b6068a582315a0991ff8d802c475dbc-Card___save_for_future_payments.png)\n\n### Render options\n\nYou can choose between two card form render options. The following screenshots show the difference between `cardFormType` `ONE_STEP` and `STEP_BY_STEP`:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/7525725793bb95941157225f086e5abaa58875401b435703e4d3e69e217ca690-Full_SDK_android.png)\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Demo App Access\n>\n> In addition to the code examples provided, you can see the [Yuno repository](https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-android/tree/master) to complete Yuno Android SDKs implementation.\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Android SDK Release Notes](/docs/release-notes-android-sdk)[Full SDK (Android)](/docs/full-checkout-android)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Requirements](#requirements)\n  + [Step 1: Create a customer](#step-1-create-a-customer)\n  + [Step 2: Create a checkout session](#step-2-create-a-checkout-session)\n  + - [Key Parameters](#key-parameters)\n  + [Step 3: Add SDK to your project](#step-3-add-sdk-to-your-project)\n  + [Step 4: Configure permissions](#step-4-configure-permissions)\n  + [Step 5: Initialize SDK](#step-5-initialize-sdk)\n  + [Step 6: Start checkout](#step-6-start-checkout)\n  + [Step 7: Get payment one-time token (OTT)](#step-7-get-payment-one-time-token-ott)\n  + [Step 8: Create payment](#step-8-create-payment)\n  + [Complementary features](#complementary-features)\n  + - [styles](#styles)\n    - [Loader](#loader)\n    - [Save card for future payments](#save-card-for-future-payments)\n    - [Render options](#render-options)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/bb2c987a467228d113d98035f453a459aedfb41554aad3eb49fc50fed8dbf0a0-Screenshot_2025-06-04_at_10.45.05_AM.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/bb2c987a467228d113d98035f453a459aedfb41554aad3eb49fc50fed8dbf0a0-Screenshot_2025-06-04_at_10.45.05_AM.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "paypal - paypal - paypal - paypal - paypal - paypal - paypal - paypal - paypal - paypal - paypal - paypal - paypal - paypal - paypal - paypal - pay"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/1c3d62f0307923298b22f18a1e58f86f8b6068a582315a0991ff8d802c475dbc-Card___save_for_future_payments.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/1c3d62f0307923298b22f18a1e58f86f8b6068a582315a0991ff8d802c475dbc-Card___save_for_future_payments.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the payment screen with the payment button highlighted"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/7525725793bb95941157225f086e5abaa58875401b435703e4d3e69e217ca690-Full_SDK_android.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/7525725793bb95941157225f086e5abaa58875401b435703e4d3e69e217ca690-Full_SDK_android.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a phone with a credit card on the screen"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/headless-sdk-enrollment", "title": "Headless SDK (Enrollment Web)", "content_markdown": "# Headless SDK (Enrollment Web)\n\n> 👍\n>\n> ### Recommended SDK\n>\n> We recommend using the [Web Seamless SDK](seamless-sdk-payment-web) for a smooth integration experience. This option provides a flexible payment solution with pre-built UI components and customization options.\n\nYuno's Headless SDK lets you enroll in payment methods and tokenize cards, saving them for future usage.\n\nThe following steps describe creating a payment using Yuno's Headless SDK.\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo execute the enrollment process, you need to provide the `customer_session` to start the enrollment process in [Step 3](/docs/headless-sdk-enrollment#step-3-create-a-customer-session). To acquire the `customer_session`, you need to:\n\n1. **Create a customer**: A customer is required to enroll in payments. Use the [Create Customer](/reference/create-customer) endpoint to create new customers. In the response, you will receive the customer `id`, which you use to create the customer session.\n2. **Create the customer session**: Use the customer `id` and the [Create Customer Session](/reference/create-customer-session) endpoint to receive the `customer_session`.\n\n## Step 1: Include the library in your project\n\nBefore proceeding with the Headless SDK implementation, see the [SDK Integration Overview](/docs/build-your-integration) for detailed instructions on how to properly integrate the SDK into your project.\n\nThe integration guide provides three flexible methods:\n\n1. Direct HTML script inclusion\n2. Dynamic JavaScript injection\n3. NPM module installation\n\nChoose the integration method that best suits your development workflow and technical requirements. After completing the SDK integration, you can proceed with the following steps to implement the headless enrollment functionality.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### TypeScript Library\n>\n> If you are using TypeScript, Yuno provides a [library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yuno-payments/sdk-web-types) that you can use to see all available methods in the Yuno Web SDK.\n\n## Step 2: Initialize Headless SDK with the public key\n\nIn your JavaScript application, create an instance of the `Yuno` class by providing a valid `PUBLIC_API_KEY`.\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst yuno = await Yuno.initialize(PUBLIC_API_KEY);\n```\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Credentials\n>\n> See the credentials page for more information: [https://docs.y.uno/reference/authentication](/reference/authentication)\n\n## Step 3: Create a customer session\n\nTo start the enrollment process, you need to provide the `customer_session`. First, you need to create a customer. You need a customer to enroll payments with. Use the [Create Customer](/reference/create-customer) endpoint to create new customers. In the response, you will receive the customer `id`, which you use to create the customer session.\n\nAfter creating the customer, you can create the customer session. Use the customer `id` and the [Create Customer Session](/reference/create-customer-session) endpoint. The `customer_session` will be provided in the response. You need a new `customer_session` every time you enroll in a new payment method.\n\n## Step 4: Create an enrollment payment method object\n\nYou need an enrollment payment method object to set Headless SDK integration for enrollment. You can create one using the [Enroll Payment Method](/reference/enroll-payment-method-checkout) endpoint. While creating the payment method object, you need to define which payment method your customer can enroll in. Currently, only CARD is available for Headless SDK.\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Verify Card\n>\n> If you want to verify cards (zero value authorization) before enrollment, you need to provide the `verify` object when creating the payment method object for the customer session.\n\n## Step 5: Start the enrollment process\n\nNext, you will start the checkout process using the `apiClientEnroll` function, providing the necessary configuration parameters.\n\n### Parameters\n\nConfigure the enrollment with the following options:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `country_code` | This parameter specifies the country for which the payment process is being set up. Use an `ENUM` value representing the desired country code. You can find the full list of supported countries and their corresponding codes on the [Country Coverage](/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk) page. |\n| `customer_session` | Refers to the current enrollment's [customer session](/docs/sessions) received as a response to the [Create Customer Session](/reference/create-customer-session) endpoint. Example: `'438413b7-4921-41e4-b8f3-28a5a0141638'` |\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst apiClientEnroll = yuno.apiClientEnroll({\n  country_code: \"CO\",\n  customer_session: \"eec6578e-ac2f-40a0-8065-25b5957f6dd3\"\n});\n```\n\n## Step 6: Generate a vaulted token\n\nAfter collecting all user information, you can start the enrollment. First, you need to create a `vaulted_token` using the function `apiClientEnroll.continueEnrollment`. As it is an asynchronous function, you can use `try/catch` to ensure you will correctly handle triggered errors. The following example shows how to create a `vaulted_token`:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst vaultedTokenResponse = await apiClientEnroll.continueEnrollment({\n  customer_session: \"eec6578e-ac2f-40a0-8065-25b5957f6dd3\",\n  payment_method: {\n    type: \"CARD\",\n    card: {\n      detail: {\n        expiration_month: 11,\n        expiration_year: 25,\n        number: \"4111111111111111\",\n        security_code: \"123\",\n        holder_name: \"ANDREA B\",\n        type: \"DEBIT\"\n      }\n    },\n    customer: {\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\nAfter enrolling the new card, you will receive the `vaulted_token`, which you can use to make payments in the future without asking for your customer's card information. The following code block shows an example of a response from the `apiClientEnroll.continueEnrollment` function:\n\nJSON\n\n```\n{\n vaulted_token: \"9104911d-5df9-429e-8488-ad41abea1a4b\",\n customer: {\n   session: \"eec6578e-ac2f-40a0-8065-25b5957f6dd3\"\n },\n status: \"ENROLLED\"\n}\n```\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Possible Status Values\n>\n> The `status` field can have one of the following values:\n>\n> * `CREATED`\n> * `EXPIRED`\n> * `REJECTED`\n> * `READY_TO_ENROLL`\n> * `ENROLL_IN_PROCESS`\n> * `UNENROLL_IN_PROCESS`\n> * `IN_PROCESS`\n> * `ENROLLED`\n> * `DECLINED`\n> * `CANCELED`\n> * `ERROR`\n> * `UNENROLLED`\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Demo App\n>\n> In addition to the code examples provided, you can access the [Demo App](../docs/demo-app) for a complete implementation of Yuno SDKs.\n\n## Stay Updated\n\nVisit the [changelog](/changelog) for the latest SDK updates and version history.\n\nUpdated about 1 month ago\n\n---\n\n[Headless SDK](/docs/headless-sdk-web)[Headless SDK (Payment Web)](/docs/headless-sdk-payment)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Requirements](#requirements)\n  + [Step 1: Include the library in your project](#step-1-include-the-library-in-your-project)\n  + [Step 2: Initialize Headless SDK with the public key](#step-2-initialize-headless-sdk-with-the-public-key)\n  + [Step 3: Create a customer session](#step-3-create-a-customer-session)\n  + [Step 4: Create an enrollment payment method object](#step-4-create-an-enrollment-payment-method-object)\n  + [Step 5: Start the enrollment process](#step-5-start-the-enrollment-process)\n  + - [Parameters](#parameters)\n  + [Step 6: Generate a vaulted token](#step-6-generate-a-vaulted-token)\n  + [Stay Updated](#stay-updated)", "images": [], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/enrollment-android", "title": "Lite SDK (Enrollment Android)", "content_markdown": "# Lite SDK (Enrollment Android)\n\nThis page provides a guide to the Yuno Lite SDK for Android enrollment. This SDK offers a streamlined integration process with essential enrollment functionality, making it ideal for merchants who:\n\n* Need a quick implementation with minimal customization requirements\n* Want to focus primarily on payment method enrollment\n* Prefer a ready-to-use UI that handles the enrollment flow\n\nThe Lite SDK includes core features like:\n\n* Pre-built enrollment UI components\n* Card enrollment processing\n* Basic enrollment status handling\n* Essential error management\n\nFor merchants requiring more advanced features like multiple payment methods, custom UI, or advanced fraud prevention, consider using our [Full SDK](/docs/full-checkout-android) instead.\n\n## Requirements\n\nBefore starting the Yuno Android SDK integration, ensure your project meets the [technical requirements](/docs/requirements-android). Also, ensure the following prerequisites are in place:\n\n* You must have an active Yuno account\n* You need your Yuno API credentials (`public-api-key`), which you can obtain from the [Developers section of the Yuno dashboard](../docs/developers-credentials)\n* Before enrolling a payment method, you must first create a customer using the [Create customer endpoint](/reference/create-customer)\n\n## Step 1: Create a customer\n\nCreate a customer in Yuno's system using the [Create customer endpoint](/reference/create-customer) before enrolling payment methods. This endpoint will return a `customer_id` that you'll use to associate enrolled payment methods with the specific customer.\n\nThe endpoint will return a `customer_session` that you'll need to use when calling the enrollment methods.\n\n## Step 2: Include the library in your project\n\nAdd the Yuno Lite SDK to your Android project:\n\n### Add the Repository\n\nAdd Yuno's Maven repository to your project's Gradle configuration:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nmaven { url \"https://yunopayments.jfrog.io/artifactory/snapshots-libs-release\" }\n```\n\nInclude the following code in the `build.gradle` file to add the Yuno SDK dependency to the application:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'com.yuno.payments:android-sdk:{last_version}'\n}\n```\n\n### Permissions\n\nThe Yuno SDK includes the `INTERNET` permission by default, which is required to make network requests.\n\nXML\n\n```\n<uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" />\n```\n\n## Step 3: Initialize SDK with the public key\n\nInitialize the SDK:\n\n1. Get your Public API Key from the [Yuno Dashboard](https://dashboard.y.uno/)\n2. Create a custom application class if you haven't already done so\n3. In the `onCreate()` method of your application class, call `Yuno.initialize()` with your API key:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nclass CustomApplication : Application() {\n  override fun onCreate() {\n    super.onCreate()\n    Yuno.initialize(\n      this,\n      PUBLIC_API_KEY,\n      config: YunoConfig,\n    )\n  }\n}\n```\n\nUse the data class `YunoConfig` to customize the SDK's behavior. Include this configuration when calling `Yuno.initialize()`. The available options are:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\ndata class YunoConfig(\n    val cardFlow: CardFormType = CardFormType.ONE_STEP,\n    val saveCardEnabled: Boolean = false,\n    val keepLoader: Boolean = false,\n    val cardFormDeployed: Boolean = false,\n    val language: YunoLanguage? = null,\n    val styles: YunoStyles? = null\n)\n```\n\nThe following table describes each customization option:\n\n| Customization option | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| **cardFlow** | This optional configuration defines Payment and Enrollment Card flow. By default, the `CardFormType.ONE_STEP` option is used. See the [Render options](#render-options) section for more information. |\n| **saveCardEnabled** | Enables the **Save card checkbox** on card flows. See the [Save card](#save-card-for-future-payments) section for more information. |\n| **keepLoader** | Keep Yuno's loading screen until you create and continue with payment. To use this feature, use the function `startCompletePaymentFlow()`, described in the next sections. See the [Loader](#loader) for additional information. |\n| **language** | Defines the language to be used in the payment forms. You can set it to one of the available language options:  * es (Spanish) * en (English) * pt (Portuguese) * fil (Filipino) * id (Indonesian) * ms (Malay) * th (Thai) * zh-TW (Chinese (Traditional, Taiwan)) * zh-CN (Chinese (Simplified, China)) * vi (Vietnamese) * fr (French) * pl (Polish) * it (Italian) * de (German) * ru (Russian) * tr (Turkish) * nl (Dutch) * sv (Swedish) * ko (Korean) * ja (Japanese) |\n|  | * `pt` (Portuguese) |\n| **styles** | Enables SDK-wide UI customization. Use it to define global visual styles like font family and button appearance (color, padding, radius, typography) through a `YunoStyles` object. For more information, see the [`styles`](../docs/full-checkout-android#styles) section. |\n\nYou also need to update your manifest to use your application:\n\nXML\n\n```\n<application android:name=\".CustomApplication\"></application>\n```\n\n## Step 4: Enroll a new payment method\n\nThe enrollment process is a two-step flow. First, initialize the process to set up the necessary components. Then, start the UI flow to allow the user to enroll a payment method.\n\n### 4.1 Initialize the enrollment process\n\nCall the `initEnrollment` method within your activity's `onCreate` method to prepare your app to handle the enrollment flow. This is a mandatory setup step required by the Android operating system to register the contract that allows the SDK to send the final enrollment status back to your app.\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nfun ComponentActivity.initEnrollment(\n    callbackEnrollmentState: ((String?) -> Unit)? = null\n)\n```\n\n### 4.2 Start the enrollment flow\n\nCall the `startEnrollment` method to launch the user interface and begin the enrollment of a new payment method. You can call this method at any point after `initEnrollment` has been executed, such as when a user taps an \"Enroll New Payment Method\" button.\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nfun Activity.startEnrollment(\n    customerSession: String,\n    countryCode: String,\n    showEnrollmentStatus: Boolean = true,\n    callbackEnrollmentState: ((String?) -> Unit)? = null,\n    requestCode: Int\n)\n```\n\nThe following table describes the `startEnrollment` parameters:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `customerSession` | The session customer associated with the current enrollment process. |\n| `countryCode` | Country code where the payment is performed. See [Country coverage](/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk) for a complete list of supported countries and their codes. |\n| `showEnrollmentStatus` | Indicates whether the enrollment status should be shown. This parameter is optional and defaults to `true`. |\n| `callbackEnrollmentState` | A function that returns the current state of the enrollment process. This parameter is optional and defaults to `null`. To register this callback, you must call `initEnrollment` method in the `onCreate` method of the activity. Check the [possible states](#callback-enrollment-state) that can be returned. |\n| `requestCode` | It is an optional parameter you must inform if you are going to use the `onActivityResult` method to capture the enrollment states. |\n\n### Callback Enrollment State\n\nThe `callbackEnrollmentState` parameter is a function that returns the current enrollment process status. Provide this function only if you want to track the enrollment status.\n\nUse the `AppCompatActivity.enrollmentStatus()` function to check the current enrollment state at any time. This function is optional and accepts the same parameters as `startEnrollment`. The following code block shows the function signature:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nfun AppCompatActivity.enrollmentStatus(\n    customerSession: String,\n    countryCode: String,\n    showEnrollmentStatus: Boolean = false,\n    callbackEnrollmentState: ((String?) -> Unit)? = null,\n)\n```\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Optional Function\n>\n> Using the function `enrollmentStatus` is optional. It isn't a requirement to complete the enrollment process. [Learn more](#enrollmentStatus)\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Callback Override\n>\n> If you provide a new callback when calling the function `enrollmentStatus`, it will override the callback you set when calling the function `initEnrollment`.\n\nThe following code block shows the possible states:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nconst val ENROLLMENT_STATE_SUCCEEDED = \"SUCCEEDED\"\nconst val ENROLLMENT_STATE_FAIL = \"FAIL\"\nconst val ENROLLMENT_STATE_PROCESSING = \"PROCESSING\"\nconst val ENROLLMENT_STATE_REJECT = \"REJECT\"\nconst val ENROLLMENT_STATE_INTERNAL_ERROR = \"INTERNAL_ERROR\"\nconst val ENROLLMENT_STATE_CANCELED_BY_USER = \"CANCELED\"\n```\n\nThe following table provides additional information about the possible states:\n\n| **State** | **Description** | **Additional action required** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `SUCCEEDED` | The enrollment process was successfully completed without any errors. | No. |\n| `FAIL` | The enrollment attempt failed due to errors such as data validation issues, server connection failures, or technical problems. | Yes. Investigate the cause of failure (validation, network, server) and take corrective measures. |\n| `PROCESSING` | The enrollment is currently in progress, awaiting approval or verification. | No. |\n| `REJECT` | The enrollment was rejected due to reasons such as missing requirements or detected inconsistencies. | Yes. Inform the user of the rejection, provide the reason if possible, and suggest next steps. |\n| `INTERNAL_ERROR` | An unexpected internal error occurred within the system handling the enrollment process. | Yes. Requires technical intervention to review the system, fix internal issues, and retry or inform the user. |\n| `CANCELED` | The user voluntarily canceled the enrollment process or exited before completion. | No. |\n\n### Using the `OnActivityResult` method\n\n> ❗️\n>\n> ### Deprecated Method\n>\n> The `onActivityResult` method is a deprecated solution. If you are performing a new Android integration, Yuno recommends using the `initEnrollment()` contract, which follows Google's best practices.\n\nThe **onActivityResult** method is automatically invoked when an activity returns a result. You can use this option to execute actions whenever the enrollment status changes. Follow these steps to process the enrollment result:\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Using Default Request Code\n>\n> If you are using the `onActivityResult` method but did not inform a `requestCode` when calling the `startEnrollment` in [Step 3](#step-3-enroll-a-new-payment-method), you must use the `YUNO_ENROLLMENT_REQUEST_CODE` provided by Yuno.\n\n1. Override the `onActivityResult` method. This ensures that the hierarchy calls are respected.\n\nkotl\n\n```\noverride fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) {\n    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)\n}\n```\n\n2. Check if the `requestCode` corresponds to `YUNO_ENROLLMENT_REQUEST_CODE`. Since you are running `Yuno` in your app, you can import the `YUNO_ENROLLMENT_REQUEST_CODE` to use it.\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nif (requestCode == YUNO_ENROLLMENT_REQUEST_CODE) {\n}\n```\n\n3. If the `requestCode` matches, handle the enrollment result. Extract the enrollment state using the `YUNO_ENROLLMENT_RESULT` key provided by the Yuno library. Create an `onEnrollmentStateChange` function to handle the state changes.\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nonEnrollmentStateChange(data?.getStringExtra(YUNO_ENROLLMENT_RESULT))\n```\n\nThe following code block shows an example of code to use the `OnActivityResult` method to execute functions when the enrollment status changes:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\noverride fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) {\n    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)\n\n    if (requestCode == YUNO_ENROLLMENT_REQUEST_CODE) {\n        val enrollmentState = data?.getStringExtra(YUNO_ENROLLMENT_RESULT)\n        onEnrollmentStateChange(enrollmentState)\n    }\n}\n\nfun onEnrollmentStateChange(enrollmentState: String?) {\n    when (enrollmentState) {\n        \"SUCCEEDED\" -> {\n        }\n        \"FAIL\" -> {\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Step 5: Get enrollment status\n\nCall the `initEnrollment` method in the `onCreate` method of activity to register a callback to get the final enrollment state.\n\n## Complementary features\n\nYuno Android SDK provides additional services and configurations you can use to improve customers' experience. Use the [SDK customization](/docs/sdk-customizations-android) to change the SDK appearance to match your brand or to configure the loader.\n\n### `styles`\n\nWith the `styles` customization option, you can define global visual styles through a `YunoStyles` object. It lets you apply consistent branding across the SDK by customizing button appearance and typography.\n\nKotlin\n\n```\ndata class YunoStyles(\n    val buttonStyles: YunoButtonStyles? = null,\n    val fontFamily: FontFamily? = null\n)\n```\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `buttonStyles` | Customizes the primary buttons displayed in the SDK. |\n| `fontFamily` | Sets the font family used across all SDK text elements. |\n\nThe `YunoButtonStyles` object lets you define specific settings for button appearance:\n\nKotlin\n\n```\ndata class YunoButtonStyles(\n    val backgroundColor: Color? = null,\n    val contentColor: Color? = null,\n    val cornerRadius: Dp? = null,\n    val elevation: Dp? = null,\n    val padding: Dp? = null,\n    val fontFamily: FontFamily? = null,\n    val fontSize: TextUnit? = null,\n    val fontStyle: FontStyle? = null\n)\n```\n\nUse the `YunoConfig` data class, described in Step 3, to use the `styles` customization option.\n\n### Loader\n\nThe loader functionality is controlled through the `keepLoader` parameter in the `YunoConfig` data class, which is documented inline in the SDK configuration section above.\n\n### Render options\n\nYou can choose between two card form render options. The following screenshots show the difference between `cardFormType` `ONE_STEP` and `STEP_BY_STEP`:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/7525725793bb95941157225f086e5abaa58875401b435703e4d3e69e217ca690-Full_SDK_android.png)\n\n### SDK customization\n\nYou can change the SDK appearance to match your brand. For more information, see the [SDK customization](../docs/sdk-customizations-android) page.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Demo App\n>\n> In addition to the code examples provided, you can see the [Yuno repository](https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-android/tree/master) to complete Yuno Android SDKs implementation.\n\n## Render mode (enrollment)\n\nThe Yuno SDK render mode lets you integrate the enrollment flow with full UI control while keeping SDK validation and logic. The SDK returns Android `Fragment` instances that you can display in both Jetpack Compose (via AndroidView) and traditional XML layouts.\n\n### Main function: `startEnrollmentRender`\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nfun Activity.startEnrollmentRender(\n    customerSession: String,\n    countryCode: String,\n    submitButton: Boolean = false,\n    coroutineScope: CoroutineScope,\n    listener: YunoEnrollmentRenderListener\n): YunoEnrollmentFragmentController\n```\n\n#### Parameters\n\n| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `customerSession` | `String` | Yes | The customer session for the current enrollment process |\n| `countryCode` | `String` | Yes | Country code for regional configuration |\n| `submitButton` | `Boolean` | No | If `true`, the SDK renders submit actions internally; otherwise use your UI |\n| `coroutineScope` | `CoroutineScope` | Yes | Scope used for running async operations tied to the Activity lifecycle |\n| `listener` | `YunoEnrollmentRenderListener` | Yes | Listener that receives fragments, loading, and final status events |\n\n#### Return value\n\nReturns a `YunoEnrollmentFragmentController` to control the enrollment flow (e.g., submit forms).\n\n#### Usage example\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nclass EnrollmentActivity : Activity() {\n\n    private lateinit var fragmentController: YunoEnrollmentFragmentController\n\n    private fun initializeEnrollment() {\n        fragmentController = startEnrollmentRender(\n            customerSession = \"your_customer_session_id\",\n            countryCode = \"US\",\n            submitButton = false,\n            coroutineScope = lifecycleScope,\n            listener = enrollmentRenderListener\n        )\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Interface: `YunoEnrollmentRenderListener`\n\nImplement this interface to receive enrollment fragments and events.\n\nKotlin\n\n```\ninterface YunoEnrollmentRenderListener {\n    fun showView(fragment: Fragment, needSubmit: Boolean)\n    fun returnStatus(resultCode: Int, paymentStatus: String)\n    fun loadingListener(isLoading: Boolean)\n}\n```\n\n#### showView(fragment: Fragment, needSubmit: Boolean)\n\n* Receives the fragment to display in your UI container\n* `needSubmit` indicates whether you should display your own submit button (when `submitButton = false`)\n\nExample (XML):\n\nKotlin\n\n```\noverride fun showView(fragment: Fragment, needSubmit: Boolean) {\n    supportFragmentManager.beginTransaction()\n        .replace(R.id.enrollment_container, fragment)\n        .commit()\n\n    clientSubmitButton.isVisible = needSubmit\n    if (needSubmit) {\n        clientSubmitButton.setOnClickListener { fragmentController.submitForm() }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### returnStatus(resultCode: Int, paymentStatus: String)\n\n* Final enrollment status event. Use it to notify the user of success or failure\n\n#### loadingListener(isLoading: Boolean)\n\n* Loading state callback for showing/hiding spinners and disabling/enabling UI\n\nKotlin\n\n```\noverride fun loadingListener(isLoading: Boolean) {\n    progressBar.isVisible = isLoading\n    clientSubmitButton.isEnabled = !isLoading\n}\n```\n\n### Interface: `YunoEnrollmentFragmentController`\n\nReturned by `startEnrollmentRender` to control the enrollment flow.\n\nKotlin\n\n```\ninterface YunoEnrollmentFragmentController {\n    fun submitForm()\n}\n```\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nval fragmentController = startEnrollmentRender(\n    customerSession = \"your_customer_session_id\",\n    countryCode = \"US\",\n    submitButton = false,\n    coroutineScope = lifecycleScope,\n    listener = enrollmentRenderListener\n)\n```\n\n3. Control the flow (submit when needed):\n\nKotlin\n\n```\nfragmentController.submitForm()\n```\n\n## Advantages of Render Mode\n\n### UI flexibility\n\n* Compatible with both Compose (via AndroidView) and XML\n* Full control over where and how views are displayed\n* Easy to match your app’s design system\n\n### Flow control\n\n* Custom submit timing using `submitForm()`\n\n## Important considerations\n\n* Tie `coroutineScope` to your Activity/Fragment lifecycle (e.g., `lifecycleScope`)\n* When `needSubmit = true`, render your own submit button and call `submitForm()`\n* In Compose, place the fragment in an `AndroidView` container\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Lite SDK (Payment Android)](/docs/lite-checkout-android)[Headless SDKs (Android)](/docs/alternative-sdks-1)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Requirements](#requirements)\n  + [Step 1: Create a customer](#step-1-create-a-customer)\n  + [Step 2: Include the library in your project](#step-2-include-the-library-in-your-project)\n  + - [Add the Repository](#add-the-repository)\n    - [Permissions](#permissions)\n  + [Step 3: Initialize SDK with the public key](#step-3-initialize-sdk-with-the-public-key)\n  + [Step 4: Enroll a new payment method](#step-4-enroll-a-new-payment-method)\n  + - [4.1 Initialize the enrollment process](#41-initialize-the-enrollment-process)\n    - [4.2 Start the enrollment flow](#42-start-the-enrollment-flow)\n    - [Callback Enrollment State](#callback-enrollment-state)\n    - [Using the OnActivityResult method](#using-the-onactivityresult-method)\n  + [Step 5: Get enrollment status](#step-5-get-enrollment-status)\n  + [Complementary features](#complementary-features)\n  + - [styles](#styles)\n    - [Loader](#loader)\n    - [Render options](#render-options)\n    - [SDK customization](#sdk-customization)\n  + [Render mode (enrollment)](#render-mode-enrollment)\n  + - [Main function: startEnrollmentRender](#main-function-startenrollmentrender)\n    - [Interface: YunoEnrollmentRenderListener](#interface-yunoenrollmentrenderlistener)\n    - [Interface: YunoEnrollmentFragmentController](#interface-yunoenrollmentfragmentcontroller)\n  + [Advantages of Render Mode](#advantages-of-render-mode)\n  + - [UI flexibility](#ui-flexibility)\n    - [Flow control](#flow-control)\n  + [Important considerations](#important-considerations)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/7525725793bb95941157225f086e5abaa58875401b435703e4d3e69e217ca690-Full_SDK_android.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/7525725793bb95941157225f086e5abaa58875401b435703e4d3e69e217ca690-Full_SDK_android.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a phone with a credit card on the screen"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

This adds an extra layer of security beyond authentication methods like OAuth.\n\nWhile OAuth provides authentication (verifying who is sending the request), HMAC signatures provide:\n\n* **Data integrity**: Confirms the webhook payload hasn't been tampered with\n* **Authenticity**: Verifies the webhook genuinely comes from Yuno\n* **Protection**: Guards against man-in-the-middle attacks and replay attacks\n* **Compliance**: Meets security requirements for handling sensitive payment data\n\n## How HMAC signatures work\n\nWhen Yuno sends a webhook to your server:\n\n1. **Signature generation**: Yuno creates an HMAC signature by hashing the webhook payload with your client secret key using the SHA-256 algorithm\n2. **Header inclusion**: The signature is included in the `x-hmac-signature` HTTP header\n3. **Verification**: Your server extracts the signature from the header, recreates it using the same payload and secret key, then compares\n4. **Validation**: If the signatures match, the webhook is authentic and unaltered\n\n## Configuration\n\nTo enable HMAC signature verification, check **Use HMAC Authentication** when creating or editing a webhook in the [Yuno dashboard](https://dashboard.y.uno/).\n\nSee [Configure Webhooks](/docs/configure-webhooks) for step-by-step instructions on accessing the webhook configuration panel.\n\n## What changes with HMAC\n\nWhen HMAC signature verification is enabled, Yuno webhooks include an additional `x-hmac-signature` HTTP header. The webhook JSON payload remains unchanged.\n\n### Example webhook request with HMAC\n\nHTTP\n\n```\nPOST /your-webhook-endpoint HTTP/1.1\nHost: your-server.com\nContent-Type: application/json\nx-api-key: your-api-key\nx-secret: your-secret\nx-hmac-signature: K7gNU3sdo+OL0wNhqoVWhr3g6s1xYv72ol/pe/Unols=\n\n{\n  \"type\": \"payment\",\n  \"type_event\": \"payment.purchase\",\n  \"account_id\": \"2c05976d-1234-1234-1234-6421883de48d\",\n  \"retry\": 0,\n  \"version\": 2,\n  \"data\": {\n    \"payment\": {\n      \"id\": \"a546c566-1703-4fba-b334-c46e89bc97f7\",\n      \"status\": \"SUCCEEDED\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Related documentation\n\n* [Configure Webhooks](/docs/configure-webhooks)\n* [Webhook Examples](/docs/examples)\n* [Webhooks Overview](/docs/webhooks)\n\nUpdated 19 days ago\n\n---\n\n[Object and Examples](/docs/examples)[Wallets Overview](/docs/wallets)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [How HMAC signatures work](#how-hmac-signatures-work)\n  + [Configuration](#configuration)\n  + [What changes with HMAC](#what-changes-with-hmac)\n  + - [Example webhook request with HMAC](#example-webhook-request-with-hmac)\n  + [Related documentation](#related-documentation)", "images": [], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/payment-methods", "title": "Payment methods", "content_markdown": "# Payment methods\n\nYuno offers a wide range of connections with various processors and payment methods, continuously expanding each month. This page explains the available payment methods, their capabilities, and how they are organized within Yuno's platform.\n\n## What is a payment method?\n\nTo better understand the payment process, it's essential to differentiate between payment methods and processors.\n\n* **Payment method**: A payment method is a way to collect customer payment information and send it to a processor for payment processing. Common payment methods include:\n  + Credit/debit cards\n  + Digital wallets (Apple Pay, Google Pay)\n  + Bank transfers (iDeal)\n  + Buy now, pay later services (Klarna)\n  + Regional payment methods (UPI, Pix)\n* **Processors**: Processors act as intermediaries between the merchant's and customer's banks, managing refunds, cancellations, and facilitating payment processing. They handle the actual processing of the information obtained by the payment method.\n\n## Differences between payment methods\n\nPayment methods can differ significantly regarding their processing. In addition, some may support enrollment, while others do not. Payment methods can be divided based on their **enrollment characteristics** and **user interaction**.\n\n### User interaction\n\nThe workflow for payment methods can vary depending on the capabilities of each processor and the actions required by the customer to complete the payment. There are two main types: synchronous and asynchronous.\n\n* **Synchronous**: Synchronous payment methods provide an instant final result once the customer clicks **Pay**, and the payment is created by the merchant in the background. In these cases, you do not need webhooks to know the outcome, as it will be given in the payment response.\n* **Asynchronous**: Asynchronous payment methods, on the other hand, require an additional step by the customer to finalize the payment. These payments will have an intermediate status of `PENDING` until the customer completes the payment or the processor notifies Yuno of the final outcome. To stay up to date on these statuses, it is important to configure [Webhooks](/docs/webhooks-1) in your Yuno account for instant updates.\n\n### Enrollment\n\nIn Yuno, **enrollment** refers to the process of storing a customer's payment method information for future purchases. This allows for seamless transactions initiated either by the customer or the merchant without requiring additional input from the customer.\n\n* **Enrollable payment methods**: Yuno offers various payment methods for enrollment. The most popular option is **Credit/Debit cards**, but we also offer alternative payment methods, mainly wallets, which allow customers to provide their account information for future payments.\n* **Non-enrollable payment methods**: Payment methods that cannot be enrolled are typically alternative methods, such as those relying on bank transfers or cash payments, which may require the customer to take action for each payment.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/d965e232b43c86df6cd11c21e576eb7821786426f8e38373256ee9a88cae3c37-Payment_methods.png)\n\nUpdated 6 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Tokens](/docs/tokens)[Webhooks](/docs/webhooks-1)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [What is a payment method?](#what-is-a-payment-method)\n  + [Differences between payment methods](#differences-between-payment-methods)\n  + - [User interaction](#user-interaction)\n    - [Enrollment](#enrollment)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/d965e232b43c86df6cd11c21e576eb7821786426f8e38373256ee9a88cae3c37-Payment_methods.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/d965e232b43c86df6cd11c21e576eb7821786426f8e38373256ee9a88cae3c37-Payment_methods.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the app interface for the app app"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

Learn more in the [Cancel and Capture Flow](/docs/cancel-and-capture-flow) guide.\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Which payments can you capture\n>\n> Only payments with **PENDING** status can be captured. Check the [Payment status](../docs/payment-status) page for further details regarding the possible payment status.\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo capture a payment, you need to:\n\n* Access your [API credentials](/docs/developers-credentials) on the Yuno Dashboard, which consist of:\n  + `public-api-key`\n  + `private-secrete-key`\n* Have the payment identification data received after creating the payment using the [Create Payment endpoint](/reference/create-payment):\n  + `id`: The unique identifier of the payment, obtained from the parameter `id` after creating the payment.\n  + `transaction_id`: The unique identifier of the transaction obtained from the parameter `transaction.id` after creating the payment.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Explore Yuno Postman Collections\n>\n> Yuno provides [Postman Collections](/reference/postman-collections) that you can use to replicate the use cases locally.\n\n> 💡\n>\n> ### Capture Options\n>\n> This guide covers **manual capture** using the API endpoint. For other capture options including:\n>\n> * **Real-time capture** (immediate purchase)\n> * **Delayed capture** (automatic capture after a delay)\n>\n> See the [Cancel and Capture Flow](/docs/cancel-and-capture-flow) guide.\n\n## Capture a Payment\n\nYou can capture a payment only if it has the PENDING status. Use the [Capture Payment endpoint](/reference/capture-authorization) to capture the payment. To identify the payment to be captured, you need to provide its `id` and the `transaction_id`. In addition, you need to inform the amount to be captured using the object `amount` on the body request:\n\n* Complete refund: Leave the amount empty.\n* Partial refund: Provide the refund value using the parameter `amount`.\n\nTo confirm you have successfully captured the payment, check if the parameters from the [Capture Payment](/docs/capture-authorization) endpoint response contain the following values:\n\n* `type = CAPTURE`\n* `status = SUCCEEDED`\n* `payment.status = SUCCEEDED`\n* `payment.sub_status = CAPTURED/PARTIALLY_CAPTURED`\n\nIf the response contains the above values, the capture was successful.\n\n### Check the payment status\n\nIf, for some reason, you need to confirm the payment cancelation:\n\n* Use the [Retrieve Payment by ID](/reference/retrieve-payment-by-id) or [Retrieve Payment by merchant\\_order\\_id](/reference/retrieve-payment-by-merchant-order-id) to get detailed information about the payment.\n* Alternatively, set up webhooks to receive notifications for each event.

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/secure-fields-payment", "title": "Secure Fields (Payment)", "content_markdown": "# Secure Fields (Payment)\n\nFollow this step-by-step guide to implement and enable Yuno's Secure Fields checkout functionalities in your application.\n\n## Step 1: Include the library in your project\n\nBefore proceeding with the Secure Fields implementation, see the [SDK Integration Overview](/docs/build-your-integration) for detailed instructions on how to properly integrate the SDK into your project.\n\nThe integration guide provides three flexible methods:\n\n1. Direct HTML script inclusion\n2. Dynamic JavaScript injection\n3. NPM module installation\n\nChoose the integration method that best suits your development workflow and technical requirements. After completing the SDK integration, you can proceed with the following steps to implement the secure fields functionality.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### TypeScript Library\n>\n> If you are using TypeScript, Yuno provides a [library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yuno-payments/sdk-web-types) that you can use to see all available methods in the Yuno Web SDK.\n\n## Step 2: Initialize secure fields with the public key\n\nIn your JavaScript application, create an instance of the `Yuno` class by providing a valid `PUBLIC_API_KEY`:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst yuno = await Yuno.initialize(PUBLIC_API_KEY);\n```\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Credentials\n>\n> See the credentials page for more information: [https://docs.y.uno/reference/authentication](/reference/authentication)\n\n## Step 3: Start the checkout process\n\nYou will start the checkout process. To do it, use the `secureFields` function and provide the necessary configuration parameters:\n\nThe essential parameters are the `countrycode`, which determines the country for which the payment process is configured, and `checkoutSession`, which refers to the current payment's checkout session.\n\n### Parameters\n\nConfigure the secure fields with the following options:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `countrycode` | This parameter specifies the country for which the payment process is being set up. Use an `ENUM` value representing the desired country code. You can find the full list of supported countries and their corresponding codes on the [Country Coverage](/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk) page. |\n| `checkoutSession` | Refers to the current payment's [checkout session](/reference/create-checkout-session). `Example: '438413b7-4921-41e4-b8f3-28a5a0141638'` |\n| `installmentEnable` | This parameter is optional and is set false by default. If set True, the installments set for the account will be shown as a secure field. |\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst secureFields = yuno.secureFields({\n  countrycode: country,\n  checkoutSession,\n  installmentEnable: false\n});\n```\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Customer and Merchant-Initiated Transactions\n>\n> Payments can be initiated by the customer (CIT) or by the merchant (MIT). You find more information about their characteristics in [Stored credentials](../docs/stored-credentials).\n>\n> The step-by-step presented on this page refers to a customer-initiated transaction without the recurrence option. Typically, it's used in one-time online purchases, in-store purchases, ATM withdrawals, etc.\n\n## Step 4: Mount the Secure Fields\n\nAfter defining the parameters, you will define, configure, and mount the Secure Fields. For each Secure Field, you need to define the `name` and `options` when creating it with the `secureFields.create` function.\n\nThe following table shows all configurations available:\n\n| Parameters | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `name` | The available names for field names are **cvv**, **pan**, or **expiration**. |\n| `options.placeholder` | Default placeholder for the field. |\n| `options.styles` | Additional CSS styles for the current field. |\n| `options.label` | Field visible label. |\n| `options.showError` | Defines if errors will be shown. Available options are `true` and `false`. |\n| `options.onChange` | An auxiliary function that can be configured and will run when the field content changes. Indicates if the fields have errors or additional data. |\n| `options.onBlur` | An auxiliary function that can be configured and will run when blurring from the input. |\n| `options.validateOnBlur` | Change the validation behavior, improving the user experience by providing validation feedback after the field loses focus. It is an optional parameter that is `false` as default. |\n| `options.onFocus` | An auxiliary function that can be configured and will run when focussing on the input. |\n| `options.onRenderedSecureField` | An auxiliary function that can be configured and will run when the element finishes rendering. |\n| `options.errorMessage` | This allows for the definition of the field's error message. |\n| `options.inputMode` | *(v1.2+ only)* Defines the type of keyboard to display on mobile devices. Possible values: `'numeric'` (default) or `'text'`. |\n\nOnce you have set the parameter, you will render the created Secure Field with the `render` function by selecting an HTML element using a valid CSS selector (`#`, `.`, `[data-*]`).\n\nThe following code block shows an example of the parameter configuration for three Secure Fields, and as they are mounted, the fields are presented to the user:\n\n### Secure Field Parameters\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `name` | Field type: 'cvv', 'pan', or 'expiration' |\n| `options.placeholder` | Placeholder text displayed in the input field |\n| `options.styles` | CSS styles to be injected into the iframe. You can customize the appearance by writing CSS |\n| `options.label` | Label text for the field |\n| `options.showError` | Whether to display error messages |\n| `options.errorMessage` | Custom error message to display |\n| `options.validateOnBlur` | Whether to validate the field when it loses focus |\n| `options.onChange` | Callback function triggered when field value changes. Receives `{error, data}` where `data` contains card IIN information and installment options |\n| `options.onBlur` | Callback function triggered when field loses focus |\n| `options.onFocus` | Callback function triggered when field gains focus |\n| `options.onRenderedSecureField` | Callback function triggered when the secure field has finished rendering |\n\n### Data Available in onChange Callback\n\nWhen the `onChange` callback is triggered, the `data` parameter contains:\n\n* **Card IIN Information**: Card issuer details including scheme, brand, type, and issuer information\n* **Installment Plans**: Available installment options for the account if configured\n* **Loading States**: `isCardIINLoading` and `isInstallmentLoading` boolean flags\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst secureNumber = secureFields.create({\n    name: 'pan',\n    options: {\n      placeholder: '0000 0000 0000 0000',\n      styles: ``,\n      label: 'Card Number',\n      showError: true,\n      errorMessage: \"Custom Error\",\n      validateOnBlur: false,\n      onChange: ({ error,data }) => {\n        if (error) {\n          console.log('error_pan')\n        } else {\n          console.log('not_error_pan')\n        }\n      },\n      onBlur() {\n        console.log('blur_pan')\n      },\n      onFocus: () => {\n        console.log('focus_pan')\n      },\n      onRenderedSecureField: ()=> {\n        console.log('render completed')\n      }\n    },\n  })\n\n  secureNumber.render('#pan')\n\n  const secureExpiration = secureFields.create({\n    name: 'expiration',\n    options: {\n      placeholder: 'MM / YY',\n      styles: ``,\n      label: 'Card Expiration',\n      showError: true,\n      errorMessage: \"Custom Error\",\n      onChange: ({ error }) => {\n        if (error) {\n          console.log('error_expiration')\n        } else {\n          console.log('not_error_expiration')\n        }\n      },\n      onBlur() {\n        console.log('blur_expiration')\n      },\n      onFocus: () => {\n        console.log('focus_expiration')\n      },\n      onRenderedSecureField: ()=> {\n        console.log('render completed')\n      }\n    },\n  })\n\n  secureExpiration.render('#expiration')\n\n\n  const secureCvv = secureFields.create({\n    name: 'cvv',\n    options: {\n      placeholder: 'CVV',\n      styles: ``,\n      label: 'CVV',\n      showError: true,\n      errorMessage: \"Custom Error\",\n      onChange: ({ error }) => {\n        if (error) {\n          console.log('error_cvv')\n        } else {\n          console.log('not_error_cvv')\n        }\n      },\n      onBlur() {\n        console.log('blur_cvv')\n      },\n      onFocus: () => {\n        console.log('focus_cvv')\n      },\n      onRenderedSecureField: ()=> {\n        console.log('render completed')\n      }\n    },\n  })\n\n  secureCvv.render('#cvv')\n```\n\nBelow, you can see a GIF showing how you can configure the Secure Fields:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/9cca28f-secure-fields-checkout-sdk-1.gif)\n\n## Step 5: Generate an OTT (one-time token)\n\nWith all user information in hand, you can start the payment. First, you need to create a One-Time Token using the function `secureFields.generateToken`. As it is an asynchronous function, you can use `try/catch` to ensure you will correctly handle triggered errors. The following example shows how to create a one-time token using **vaultedToken** information:\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Benefits of Using a Vaulted Token\n>\n> When you use a vaulted token with the SDK, all the fraud information from the providers you configured in your card routing is collected and attached to the one-time token. In addition, you can add installment information and a security code if the provider requires it.\n\n### Generate Token Parameters\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `checkoutSession` | Optional: Different checkout session ID for card data persistence after payment errors |\n| `cardHolderName` | Required: Name of the cardholder |\n| `saveCard` | Optional: Whether to save the card for future payments |\n| `vaultedToken` | Optional: Use if you have a previously enrolled payment method |\n| `installment` | Optional: Required only if an installment plan is configured for the account |\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst oneTimeToken = await secureFields.generateToken({\n  checkoutSession: '{{the checkout session id}}',\n  cardHolderName: 'John Deer',\n  saveCard: true,\n  vaultedToken: \"aad8578e-ac2f-40a0-8065-25b5957f6555\",\n  installment: {\n            id: string,\n            value: number,\n            amount: {\n                currency: string,\n                value: string,\n                total_value: string,\n            },\n        },\n  customer: {\n    document: {\n      document_number: '1090209924',\n      document_type: 'CC',\n    },\n  },\n  cardType: 'DEBIT'\n})\n```\n\nYou can also use `secureFields.generateTokenWithInformation` to receive any additional info the customer gives at checkout, such as installments or document type/number.\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nCreate a one-time token with error handling:\nconst oneTimeTokenWithInformation = await secureFields.generateTokenWithInformation({ \n  checkoutSession: '{{the checkout session id}}',\n  cardHolderName: 'John Deer',\n  saveCard: true,\n  vaultedToken: \"aad8578e-ac2f-40a0-8065-25b5957f6555\",\n  installment: {\n            id: string,\n            value: number,\n            amount: {\n                currency: string,\n                value: string,\n                total_value: string,\n            },\n        },\n  customer: {\n    document: {\n      document_number: '1090209924',\n      document_type: 'CC',\n    },\n  },\n  cardType: 'DEBIT'\n})\n```\n\n## Step 6: Create the Payment\n\nAfter receiving the one-time token, you can create the payment using one of the following options:\n\n* Create the payment using the [Create Payment endpoint](/reference/create-payment).\n* Use the `createPayment` function.\n\nBoth options require you to provide the `oneTimeToken` and the `checkoutSession`. As creating the payment may raise errors, Yuno recommends you use a try/catch function here.\n\nAfter, you can check the payment status using the `yuno.mountStatusPayment` function. The following example uses the `createPayment` function to create the payment and the `mountStatusPayment` to display the payment status:\n\n### Payment Creation Flow\n\n1. **Create Payment**: Use the `createPayment` function with the one-time token and checkout session\n2. **Check SDK Action**: If `sdk_action_required` is true, call `yuno.continuePayment()` for additional customer actions\n3. **Mount Status**: If no SDK action is required, use `yuno.mountStatusPayment()` to display payment status\n\n### Mount Status Payment Parameters\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `checkoutSession` | The checkout session ID for the payment |\n| `countrycode` | Country code for the payment process |\n| `language` | Language for the status display |\n| `yunoPaymentResult` | Callback function that receives payment status updates |\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst payment = await createPayment({ oneTimeToken, checkoutSession })\n\nif (payment.checkout.sdk_action_required) {\n      yuno.continuePayment()\n} else {\n  yuno.mountStatusPayment({\n    checkoutSession: checkoutSession,\n    countrycode: 'US',\n    language: 'en',\n    yunoPaymentResult(data) {\n      console.log('yunoPaymentResult', data)\n    },\n  })\n}\n```\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Demo App\n>\n> In addition to the code examples provided, you can access the [Demo App](/docs/demo-app) for a complete implementation of Yuno SDKs. The demo app includes working examples of all Yuno SDKs and can be cloned from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-web).\n\n## Complementary features\n\nYuno Secure Fields provides additional services and configurations you can use to improve customers' experience:\n\n* [Configure and use TypeScript](#configure-and-use-typescript)\n* [Persist credit card information to retry payments](#persist-credit-card-information-to-retry-payments)\n* [Clear the values entered in the card fields](#clear-the-values-entered-in-the-card-fields)\n* [Input focus](#input-focus)\n* [Force validation](#force-validation)\n* [Set custom error message](#set-custom-error-message)\n* [Set card type](#set-card-type)\n\n### Configure and use TypeScript\n\nTo use TypeScript with the Yuno Secure Fields SDK, start by installing the type definitions via npm:\n\nShell\n\n```\nnpm install @yuno-payments/sdk-web-types\n```\n\nAfter finishing the installation, include the type definitions in your TypeScript configuration. Update the `tsconfig.json` file to include `@yuno-payments/sdk-web-types` in the types array, as in the following example:\n\nJSON\n\n```\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"types\": [\"@yuno-payments/sdk-web-types\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWith the type definitions installed and configured, you can now use them in your code. The following code block shows an example of how to initialize Yuno and create an instance:\n\nTypeScript\n\n```\nimport { YunoInstance } from '@yuno-payments/sdk-web-types/dist/types';\n\nconst yunoInstance: YunoInstance = await Yuno.initialize('yourPublicApiKey');\n```\n\nRemember to replace the `yourPublicApiKey` with your actual public API key.\n\n### Persist credit card information to retry payments\n\nIf a transaction is rejected, you can persist the credit card data to retry a payment after the customer has entered the credit card details. To do that, you need to follow the steps below:\n\n1. Add the parameter presented in the following code block while creating the one-time token in [Step 5](/docs/secure-fields-payment#step-5-generate-an-ott-one-time-token). It will enable you to receive any additional information the customer gives during checkout, such as installments, document type, or document number.\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst oneTimeTokenWithInformation = await secureFields.generateTokenWithInformation({ \n  checkoutSession: '{{the checkout session id}}',\n})\n```\n\n2. In case the transaction is rejected, you will need to:\n   i. Create a new checkout session.\n   ii. Generate a new one-time token. In the one-time token generation, send the new checkout session in the `checkoutSession` parameter.\n3. Continue with the new checkout and one-time token with the regular payment flow.\n\n### Clear the values entered in the card fields\n\nRelated to the previous functionality, the merchant can configure to clear the information entered in any card field. To accomplish this, it is necessary to execute the method `secureFieldInstance.clearValue()`, for each field that you wish to clear or delete. The following example shows how:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst secureFieldInstance = secureFields.create({...})\nsecureFieldInstance.clearValue()\n```\n\n### Input focus\n\nThe merchant can set the focus on a particular input. To accomplish this, it is necessary to execute the method `secureFieldInstance.focus()`, for each field that you wish to focus on. The following code block shows an example:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst secureFieldInstance = secureFields.create({...})\nsecureFieldInstance.focus()\n```\n\n### Force validation\n\nThe merchant can force the validation for a particular input. To accomplish this, it is necessary to execute the method `secureFieldInstance.validate()`, for each field that you wish to validate. The following code block shows an example:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst secureFieldInstance = secureFields.create({...})\nsecureFieldInstance.validate()\n```\n\n### Set custom error message\n\nThe merchant can define a custom error message after an input validation. To accomplish this, it is necessary to execute the method `secureFieldInstance.setError()`, for each field you wish to set a custom error message for. The following code block shows an example:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst secureFieldInstance = secureFields.create({...})\nsecureFieldInstance.setError('Custom error')\n```\n\n### Set card type\n\nThe merchant can define the card type the customer uses for the payment. To accomplish this, you need to execute the method `secureFieldInstance.setCardType()` and send either 'DEBIT' or 'CREDIT' for each scenario. This is useful for dual cards, where the same card can be used as credit or debit, such as in Brazil. The following code block shows an example:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst secureFieldInstance = secureFields.create({...})\nsecureFieldInstance.setCardType('CREDIT')\n```\n\n## What's next?\n\nYou can access other functions available on the Yuno Web SDK:\n\n* [SDK Customizations](/docs/sdk-customizations): Change the SDK appearance to match your brand.\n* [Payment Status](/docs/payment-status): Update the user about the payment process.\n\n## Stay Updated\n\nVisit the [changelog](/changelog) for the latest SDK updates and version history.\n\nUpdated about 1 month ago\n\n---\n\n[Secure Fields (Web)](/docs/secure-fields-web)[Secure Fields (Enrollment)](/docs/secure-fields-enrollment)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Step 1: Include the library in your project](#step-1-include-the-library-in-your-project)\n  + [Step 2: Initialize secure fields with the public key](#step-2-initialize-secure-fields-with-the-public-key)\n  + [Step 3: Start the checkout process](#step-3-start-the-checkout-process)\n  + - [Parameters](#parameters)\n  + [Step 4: Mount the Secure Fields](#step-4-mount-the-secure-fields)\n  + - [Secure Field Parameters](#secure-field-parameters)\n    - [Data Available in onChange Callback](#data-available-in-onchange-callback)\n  + [Step 5: Generate an OTT (one-time token)](#step-5-generate-an-ott-one-time-token)\n  + - [Generate Token Parameters](#generate-token-parameters)\n  + [Step 6: Create the Payment](#step-6-create-the-payment)\n  + - [Payment Creation Flow](#payment-creation-flow)\n    - [Mount Status Payment Parameters](#mount-status-payment-parameters)\n  + [Complementary features](#complementary-features)\n  + - [Configure and use TypeScript](#configure-and-use-typescript)\n    - [Persist credit card information to retry payments](#persist-credit-card-information-to-retry-payments)\n    - [Clear the values entered in the card fields](#clear-the-values-entered-in-the-card-fields)\n    - [Input focus](#input-focus)\n    - [Force validation](#force-validation)\n    - [Set custom error message](#set-custom-error-message)\n    - [Set card type](#set-card-type)\n  + [What's next?](#whats-next)\n  + [Stay Updated](#stay-updated)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/9cca28f-secure-fields-checkout-sdk-1.gif", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/9cca28f-secure-fields-checkout-sdk-1.gif", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the card is displayed on the screen"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/Cancel-and-capture-flow", "title": "Cancel and Capture Flow", "content_markdown": "# Cancel and Capture Flow\n\nWhen integrating with Yuno, you have multiple options for implementing capture and cancel operations. This guide outlines all available approaches and explains how to interact with our APIs for each scenario.\n\nWe provide simple real-time capture for fast transactions, as well as highly customizable delayed capture and cancel configurations to meet your business needs.\n\n## Overview\n\n* [**Capture modes**](#capture-modes)\n  + [Real-time capture](#real-time-capture)\n  + [Manual capture](#manual-capture)\n  + [Delayed capture](#delayed-capture)\n* [**Cancel modes**](#cancel-modes)\n  + [Manual cancel](#manual-cancel)\n  + [Delayed cancel](#delayed-cancel)\n* [**Configuration requirements**](#configuration-requirements)\n* [**Example requests**](#example-requests)\n  + [Example 1: Real-time capture](#example-1-real-time-capture)\n  + [Example 2: Manual capture only](#example-2-manual-capture-only)\n  + [Example 3: Delayed capture](#example-3-delayed-capture)\n  + [Example 4: Delayed cancel](#example-4-delayed-cancel)\n  + [Example 5: Combined delayed capture and cancel](#example-5-combined-delayed-capture-and-cancel-with-enhanced-validation)\n* [**When to use each mode**](#when-to-use-each-mode)\n* [**Field reference**](#field-reference)\n\n## Capture modes\n\nYuno provides three options for capturing payments, determined by the `capture` field and optional `delayed_capture_settings` configuration found in the [create payment API](/reference/create-payment). The actual feature availability or specific implementation details may vary depending on which payment provider you're routing your payments through.\n\n### Real-time capture\n\nThis mode processes the payment and transfers the funds without any delay, effectively combining authorization and capture into a single **purchase** operation. When `payment_method.detail.card.capture` is set to `true`, the transaction is executed as a purchase, which means the authorization and capture happen simultaneously.\n\nDepending on the payment provider's API, Yuno may execute this as one direct purchase transaction or as an authorization immediately followed by a capture call.\n\nJSON\n\n```\n{\n  \"payment_method\": {\n    \"detail\": {\n      \"card\": {\n        \"capture\": true,\n        \"card_data\": {\n          // card details\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Manual capture\n\nWith this configuration, Yuno won't capture the payment until you call the [capture API](/reference/capture-authorization) or manually capture it in your [Yuno dashboard](https://dashboard.y.uno/). Set `capture: false` to authorize the payment without capturing it.\n\nManual captures provide maximum flexibility since they give you full control of when the capture is performed. However, it's important to capture as soon as possible since payment providers enforce time limits on how long authorizations can remain uncaptured, and these limits vary by provider and region.\n\nJSON\n\n```\n{\n  \"payment_method\": {\n    \"detail\": {\n      \"card\": {\n        \"capture\": false,\n        \"card_data\": {\n          // card details\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### **Capturing Different Amounts**\n>\n> If you need to capture a different amount than originally authorized, you must use manual capture. The real-time and delayed capture modes will always capture the initially authorized amount.\n\n### Delayed capture\n\nConfigure `capture: false` along with `delayed_capture_settings` to schedule the capture of the payment for a later time, specified in the `delay` field.\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Full Amount Captures Only\n>\n> Delayed capture only applies when capturing the **full amount** of the authorization. If you need to capture a partial amount, you must use [manual capture](/docs/capture-payments) instead.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### `simplified_mode`\n>\n> Setting `simplified_mode` to `true` will make Yuno retry the capture operation in case an error occurs during the scheduled capture attempt.\n\nJSON\n\n```\n{\n  \"payment_method\": {\n    \"detail\": {\n      \"card\": {\n        \"capture\": false,\n        \"delayed_capture_settings\": {\n          \"delay\": \"P7D\",\n          \"simplified_mode\": false\n        },\n        \"card_data\": {\n          // card details\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `delay` field is required when using delayed capture operations and must follow the [ISO 8601 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations). For example:\n\n* `\"PT3H\"` for 3 hours\n* `\"P7D\"` for 7 days\n* `\"P1M\"` for 1 month\n\nIf you call the [capture API](/reference/capture-authorization) before the scheduled time, your call will override the delay and execute the capture immediately. **This action automatically cancels the scheduled Yuno trigger**. Alternatively, you can capture the payment manually through your [Yuno dashboard](https://dashboard.y.uno/).\n\n## Cancel modes\n\nWhen you authorize a payment without immediately capturing it, those funds are temporarily held on the customer's payment method. If you decide not to capture the payment, it's important to cancel the authorization to release those held funds and provide a better customer experience. Cancel modes give you control over when and how these authorizations are voided.\n\n### Manual cancel\n\nWith manual cancel mode, authorized payments stay active until you explicitly cancel them. Yuno will not automatically void these authorizations, giving you full control over when to release the funds. You can cancel authorizations using the [cancel API](/reference/cancel-or-refund-a-payment) or through your Yuno dashboard interface.\n\nIt's crucial to cancel authorizations you won't capture as soon as possible to release the held funds. Customer experience is significantly impacted when authorizations aren't canceled, as funds may remain reserved for varying periods depending on the customer's region and card network.\n\n### Delayed cancel\n\nConfigure `delayed_cancel_settings` to set a delay when canceling uncaptured authorizations, similar to delayed captures. This feature automates the release of customer funds if you decide not to capture them within a specified timeframe, significantly improving the customer experience by preventing indefinite holds on their payment methods.\n\nThe `delay` field is required when using delayed cancel operations and must follow the [ISO 8601 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations). For example:\n\n* `\"PT3H\"` for 3 hours\n* `\"P7D\"` for 7 days\n* `\"P30D\"` for 30 days\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### `simplified_mode`\n>\n> Setting `simplified_mode` to `true` will make Yuno retry the cancel operation in case an error occurs during the scheduled cancellation attempt.\n\nJSON\n\n```\n{\n  \"payment_method\": {\n    \"detail\": {\n      \"card\": {\n        \"capture\": false,\n        \"delayed_cancel_settings\": {\n          \"delay\": \"P30D\",\n          \"simplified_mode\": false\n        },\n        \"card_data\": {\n          // card details\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf you call the [capture API](/reference/capture-authorization) or [cancel API](/reference/cancel-or-refund-a-payment) before the scheduled time, your call will override the delay and execute the action immediately. **This action automatically cancels the scheduled Yuno trigger**. Alternatively, you can capture or cancel the payment manually through your Yuno dashboard.\n\n> ⚠️\n>\n> ### **Delayed Capture and Cancel Settings**\n>\n> We recommend not using **both** `delayed_capture_settings` and `delayed_cancel_settings` simultaneously to avoid unexpected behaviors. Use only one at a time based on your needs.\n\n## Configuration requirements\n\n* `delayed_capture_settings` and `delayed_cancel_settings` are only valid when `capture = false`\n* If `capture = true`, these objects must be omitted or set to `null`\n* Manual operations can be performed via API endpoints or through your Yuno dashboard\n\n## Example requests\n\n### Example 1: Real-time

recommend using only one at a time to avoid unexpected behaviors.\n\n## When to use each mode\n\n### Use real-time capture when:\n\n* You provide goods or services immediately\n* You don't need to validate inventory or fraud checks after authorization\n* You want the simplest payment flow\n\n### Use manual capture when:\n\n* You need to verify inventory before finalizing the payment\n* You want to capture a different amount than authorized\n* You have complex business logic that determines whether to capture or cancel\n* You need maximum control over the capture timing\n\n### Use delayed capture when:\n\n* You want automatic capture after a specific time period\n* You have a predictable fulfillment process\n* You want to reduce manual intervention while maintaining control\n\n### Use delayed cancel when:\n\n* You want to automatically release customer funds if you don't capture within a timeframe\n* You want to improve customer experience by not holding funds indefinitely\n* You have a maximum time limit for your fulfillment process\n\n## Field reference\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `capture` | `boolean` | Determines whether the card payment is

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/enrollment-ios", "title": "Lite SDK (Enrollment iOS)", "content_markdown": "# Lite SDK (Enrollment iOS)\n\nThis guide walks you through integrating Yuno's Lite iOS SDK for enrollment into your project.\n\n## Requirements\n\nBefore implementing the Yuno iOS SDK, ensure you meet these requirements:\n\n* Add [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html) or [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/) to your project.\n* Use iOS version 14.0 or above.\n\n## Step 1: Include the library in your project\n\nYou can add the library using CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager.\n\n### CocoaPods\n\nAdd the Yuno SDK to your iOS project using CocoaPods. If you don't have a Podfile, follow the [CocoaPods guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html) to create one. Then add the following line to your Podfile:\n\nRuby\n\n```\npod 'YunoSDK', '~> 1.1.22'\n```\n\nThen run the installation:\n\nRuby\n\n```\npod install\n```\n\n### Swift Package Manager\n\nAdd the Yuno SDK using Swift Package Manager. Add `YunoSDK` as a dependency in your Package.swift file:\n\nSwift\n\n```\ndependencies: [\n    .package(url: \"https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-ios.git\", .upToNextMajor(from: \"1.1.17\"))\n]\n```\n\n## Step 2: Enroll a new payment method\n\n> 📘\n>\n> Before calling `Yuno.enrollPayment()`, make sure you’ve initialized the SDK with `Yuno.initialize()`.\n\nYuno's iOS SDK provides an enrollment feature for payment methods. To display the enrollment flow, implement the delegate and call the enrollment method:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nprotocol YunoEnrollmentDelegate: AnyObject {\n    var customerSession: String { get }\n    var countryCode: String { get }\n    var language: String? { get }\n    var viewController: UIViewController? { get }\n\n    func yunoEnrollmentResult(_ result: Yuno.Result)\n}\n\nclass ViewController: YunoEnrollmentDelegate {\n\n    func startEnrollment() {\n        Yuno.enrollPayment(with: self, showPaymentStatus: Bool)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n`Yuno.enrollPayment()` presents a full-screen `UIViewController` modally using the `viewController` provided in your `delegate`. This works only in UIKit. In SwiftUI, wrap a `UIViewController` and return it via the `viewController` property. The `delegate` must expose a visible controller to allow the SDK to present the UI.\n\nParameters\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `customerSession` | Refers to the current payment's customer session. |\n| `countryCode` | This parameter determines the country for which the payment process is being configured. The complete list of supported countries and their country code is available on the [Country coverage](/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk) page. |\n| `language` | Defines the language to be used in the payment forms. You can set it to one of the available language options:  * es (Spanish) * en (English) * pt (Portuguese) * fil (Filipino) * id (Indonesian) * ms (Malay) * th (Thai) * zh-TW (Chinese (Traditional, Taiwan)) * zh-CN (Chinese (Simplified, China)) * vi (Vietnamese) * fr (French) * pl (Polish) * it (Italian) * de (German) * ru (Russian) * tr (Turkish) * nl (Dutch) * sv (Swedish) * ko (Korean) * ja (Japanese) |\n| `viewController` | This property represents the `UIViewController` used to present the enrollment flow. Even though the property remains optional for backward compatibility, you must supply a visible controller so the SDK can present its UI correctly. |\n| `yunoEnrollmentResult(\\_ result: Yuno.Result)` | This method is called when the enrollment process is completed, providing the result of the enrollment as a parameter of type `Yuno.Result`. |\n\nThe `showPaymentStatus` parameter determines whether the payment status should be displayed. Passing `true` shows the payment status, while passing `false` hides it.\n\nParameters\n\nThe `enrollPayment` method parameters are described below:\n\n| Parameter | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `delegate` | `YunoEnrollmentDelegate` | The delegate object that handles enrollment callbacks. |\n| `showPaymentStatus` | `Bool` | A Boolean flag that determines whether to display status views during the payment enrollment process. |\n\nThe method `enrollPayment` initiates the payment enrollment process. You should call it in response to user interactions, such as pressing a button. The method utilizes the provided `delegate` to manage enrollment events and, based on the parameter `showPaymentStatus`, decides whether to show visual feedback about the enrollment status.\n\n## Step 3: Enrollment status\n\n> ❗️\n>\n> ### Deep Link Enrollment\n>\n> This feature is only used if you enroll in a payment method that executes deep links. If you are not enrolling in a payment method that executes deep links, you can ignore Step 3.\n\nIf you use a payment method that requires a deep link to return to your app, use the method described in the following code block to obtain the enrollment status in your `AppDelegate`. The `url.scheme` should be the same as the `callback_url` used when creating the `customer_session`.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nfunc application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {\n\n  guard url.scheme == \"yunoexample\" else { return false }\n  return Yuno.receiveDeeplink(url, showStatusView: true)\n}\n```\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Swift 6 Concurrency Requirements\n>\n> If you're using Swift 6, you'll need to implement the `YunoPaymentDelegate` protocol with specific concurrency considerations. Swift 6 introduces stricter thread safety requirements that affect how you implement delegates. See the [Implementing `YunoPaymentDelegate` with Swift 6 Concurrency](#implementing-yunopaymentdelegate-with-swift-6-concurrency) section for detailed implementation options and best practices.\n\n## Understanding `Yuno.Result`\n\nWhen the enrollment process finishes, the SDK calls:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nfunc yunoEnrollmentResult(_ result: Yuno.Result)\n```\n\nThis result can reflect different final states for the enrollment. The `Yuno.Result` enum includes:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nenum Result {\n    case success\n    case fail\n    case reject\n    case processing\n    case internalError\n    case userCancell\n}\n```\n\nYou can use a switch to handle each result case:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nfunc yunoEnrollmentResult(_ result: Yuno.Result) {\n    switch result {\n    case .success:\n        print(\"Enrollment successful\")\n    case .fail:\n        print(\"Enrollment failed\")\n    case .processing:\n        print(\"Enrollment still processing\")\n    case .reject:\n        print(\"Enrollment rejected\")\n    case .userCancell:\n        print(\"User canceled\")\n    case .internalError:\n        print(\"Internal error\")\n    }\n}\n```\n\n> 📘\n>\n> `Yuno.Result` does not include tokens or error messages. You’ll only get a high-level status to help you guide the user experience.\n\n## Render mode integration (enrollment)\n\nThe render mode offers enhanced UI flexibility for enrollment, letting you integrate the enrollment flow within your own views while using the SDK’s validations and logic.\n\n### Main function: `startEnrollmentRenderFlow`\n\nSwift\n\n```\n@MainActor static func startEnrollmentRenderFlow(\n    with delegate: YunoEnrollmentDelegate\n) async -> some YunoEnrollmentRenderFlowProtocol\n```\n\n### YunoEnrollmentRenderFlowProtocol\n\nSwift\n\n```\nfunc formView(\n    with delegate: YunoEnrollmentDelegate\n) async -> AnyView?\n\nfunc submitForm()\n\nvar needSubmit: Bool { get }\n```\n\n* **formView**: Returns an `AnyView` with the enrollment form (cards/APMs) if UI is required; otherwise `nil`.\n* **submitForm**: Triggers validations and proceeds with enrollment when applicable.\n* **needSubmit**: Indicates whether you should render a submit button.\n\n### Implementation flow\n\n#### Step 1: Create enrollment flow instance\n\nSwift\n\n```\nlet enrollmentFlow = await Yuno.startEnrollmentRenderFlow(with: self)\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Get and display the form\n\nSwift\n\n```\nlet formView = await enrollmentFlow.formView(with: self)\n\nif let formView = formView {\n    VStack {\n        Text(\"Enroll Payment Method\")\n        formView\n\n        if enrollmentFlow.needSubmit {\n            Button(\"Enroll\") {\n                enrollmentFlow.submitForm()\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Handle the enrollment result\n\nSwift\n\n```\nextension MyViewController: YunoEnrollmentDelegate {\n    var customerSession: String { \"your_customer_session\" }\n    var countryCode: String { \"CO\" }\n    var language: String? { \"es\" }\n    var viewController: UIViewController? { self }\n\n    func yunoEnrollmentResult(_ result: Yuno.Result) {\n        // Handle enrollment result\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Complementary Features\n\nYuno iOS SDK provides additional services and configurations you can use to improve customers' experience.\n\n### Render option\n\nWhen presenting the enrollment, you can also choose one of the render options for the card form. You have the following options:\n\n* `ONE_STEP`\n* `STEP_BY_STEP`\n\nTo change the render option, set the `cardFormType` equal one of the available options. Each option is presented below.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/ff9a74d50d3a8d3a4e550be1b917832bd6b8daa28cc4249d9ec22edef2f410bc-Full_SDK_ios.png)\n\n### Loader\n\nControl the use of the loader through the SDK configuration options.\n\n### SDK Customizations\n\nUse the [SDK Customizations](../docs/sdk-customizations-ios) to change the SDK appearance to match your brand.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Demo App\n>\n> In addition to the code examples provided, you can access the [Yuno repository](https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-ios) for a complete implementation of Yuno iOS SDKs.\n\n## Implementing `YunoPaymentDelegate` with Swift 6 Concurrency\n\nSwift 6 introduces stricter concurrency requirements that affect how you implement the `YunoPaymentDelegate` protocol. This section explains the challenges and provides solutions for different implementation scenarios.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Understanding Concurrency in Swift 6\n>\n> Concurrency is the ability of your app to manage multiple tasks simultaneously. With Swift 6, concurrency rules have become more stringent to enhance app stability and prevent crashes. This means that your code must be more carefully structured to ensure thread safety and proper task management.\n\n### The problem\n\nWith Swift 6, protocols that inherit from `Sendable` require all their implementations to be thread-safe. This generates warnings when implementing the delegate in classes marked as `@MainActor`.\n\nThread-safe means your code can be safely called from multiple threads without causing crashes or unexpected behavior. `@MainActor` ensures code runs on the main thread (UI thread).\n\n### Our design decision\n\nWe do not mark protocols as `@MainActor` because:\n\n* It would force all implementations to be `MainActor` compatible\n* It would reduce flexibility for merchants who don't use `MainActor`\n* Each implementation has different concurrency needs\n\n### Merchant's responsibility\n\nIt's the merchant's responsibility to handle concurrency according to their implementation. Below are three different approaches you can use depending on your specific needs.\n\n#### Option 1: Immutable properties\n\nThis approach uses immutable properties that are automatically thread-safe, making them ideal for simple configurations. It is best suited for simple apps with fixed configuration values that don't change during runtime.\n\nSwift\n\n```\n@MainActor\nclass MyViewController: UIViewController, YunoPaymentDelegate {\n\n    private let _countryCode = \"CO\"\n    private let _language = \"EN\"\n\n    nonisolated var countryCode: String { _countryCode }\n    nonisolated var language: String? { _language }\n    nonisolated var checkoutSession: String { _checkoutSession }\n\n    nonisolated func yunoPaymentResult(_ result: Yuno.Result) {\n        Task { @MainActor in\n            // Handle result\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Option 2: Mutable properties with `MainActor.assumeIsolated`\n\nThis approach, best for apps where configuration values might change during runtime (like user preferences), allows for mutable properties while maintaining thread safety by using `MainActor.assumeIsolated`.\n\nSwift\n\n```\n@MainActor\nclass MyViewController: UIViewController, YunoPaymentDelegate {\n\n    @Published var configLanguage: String = \"EN\"\n    @Published var configCountryCode: String = \"CO\"\n\n    nonisolated var language: String? {\n        MainActor.assumeIsolated { configLanguage }\n    }\n\n    nonisolated var countryCode: String {\n        MainActor.assumeIsolated { configCountryCode }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Option 3: For non `MainActor` classes\n\nThis approach is suitable for service classes that don't require `MainActor` isolation, making it best for background services or utility classes that don't interact with the UI.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nclass MyService: YunoPaymentDelegate {\n\n    let countryCode: String\n    let language: String?\n    let checkoutSession: String\n    let viewController: UIViewController?\n\n    init(countryCode: String, language: String?, checkoutSession: String, viewController: UIViewController?) {\n        self.countryCode = countryCode\n        self.language = language\n        self.checkoutSession = checkoutSession\n        self.viewController = viewController\n    }\n\n    func yunoPaymentResult(_ result: Yuno.Result) {\n        // Handle result\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### ⚠️ Important considerations\n\nWhen implementing concurrency in your delegate, keep these key points in mind:\n\n* `MainActor.assumeIsolated`: Only use when you guarantee it's called from `MainActor`. This is a safety mechanism that tells Swift \"trust me, I know this is running on the main thread.\"\n* `nonisolated`: Means it can be accessed from any thread, so it must be thread-safe. Use this when your properties or methods don't depend on UI state.\n* `viewController`: Remains as `@MainActor` because it should always be accessed from the main thread. UI components must always run on the main thread to prevent crashes.\n\nUpdated 12 days ago\n\n---\n\n[Lite SDK (Payment iOS)](/docs/lite-checkout-ios)[Headless SDK (iOS)](/docs/headless-sdks-ios)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Requirements](#requirements)\n  + [Step 1: Include the library in your project](#step-1-include-the-library-in-your-project)\n  + - [CocoaPods](#cocoapods)\n    - [Swift Package Manager](#swift-package-manager)\n  + [Step 2: Enroll a new payment method](#step-2-enroll-a-new-payment-method)\n  + [Step 3: Enrollment status](#step-3-enrollment-status)\n  + [Understanding Yuno.Result](#understanding-yunoresult)\n  + [Render mode integration (enrollment)](#render-mode-integration-enrollment)\n  + - [Main function: startEnrollmentRenderFlow](#main-function-startenrollmentrenderflow)\n    - [YunoEnrollmentRenderFlowProtocol](#yunoenrollmentrenderflowprotocol)\n    - [Implementation flow](#implementation-flow)\n  + [Complementary Features](#complementary-features)\n  + - [Render option](#render-option)\n    - [Loader](#loader)\n    - [SDK Customizations](#sdk-customizations)\n  + [Implementing YunoPaymentDelegate with Swift 6 Concurrency](#implementing-yunopaymentdelegate-with-swift-6-concurrency)\n  + - [The problem](#the-problem)\n    - [Our design decision](#our-design-decision)\n    - [Merchant's responsibility](#merchants-responsibility)\n    - [⚠️ Important considerations](#%EF%B8%8F-important-considerations)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/ff9a74d50d3a8d3a4e550be1b917832bd6b8daa28cc4249d9ec22edef2f410bc-Full_SDK_ios.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/ff9a74d50d3a8d3a4e550be1b917832bd6b8daa28cc4249d9ec22edef2f410bc-Full_SDK_ios.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a phone with a credit card on the screen"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

Aida allows you to instantly access detailed information about payments, payouts, subscriptions, and payment links, making it easier to troubleshoot incidents efficiently. It can also provide webhook data and surface the status of each actor involved in the payment flow: the provider, Yuno, and the merchant. Beyond transactional insights, Aida can answer technical questions about SDK integration, API usage, and how Yuno’s platform works. It also offers details about Yuno’s technical integrations and features with supported payment providers.\n\nTo use **Aida**, simply include “Aida” in your first message and follow up with your question. If at any point the agent is unable to resolve your request, you just need to send a message that includes **“human”** and we’ll automatically notify your key account manager and technical account manager to support you directly. If you do not include \"Aida\" in your messages you will be directly communicated to your Technical Account Manager.\n\nAida is available across multiple channels:\n\n* Slack\n* Email\n* Yuno dashboard\n\n## Retrieve information about payments, payouts, subscriptions, and payment links\n\nUse Aida to look up and retrieve complete payment details. This tool is especially helpful if you want to gather all the information regarding any of these operations.\n\n### Searchable fields\n\nYou can search by any of these IDs:\n\n* `payment_code`\n* `transaction_code`\n* `order_id`\n* `trace_id`\n\n### How to search\n\nTo search, send an ID and mention \"Aida\".\n\n> “Aida, give the information for transaction\\_code: 12345”\n\n### Response\n\nAida will return all relevant payment information, including the transaction summary and full payment details.\n\n**Note:** You can also send an ID without specifying its category. Aida will automatically check across all possible types and return the relevant information once it identifies the ID.\n\n### Payment answer example\n\n```\nHere’s the information I found for Payment ID `a43a589a-e7fe-49e2-9e62-44e206026fc8` in the production environment:\n\n- **Account Name**: Velocity Airlines - Account 1  \n- **Payment Status**: Successful  \n- **Description**: Velocity Payment  \n- **Payment Method**: Credit Card (VISA)  \n  - **Issuing Bank**: JP Morgan Chase  \n  - **Cardholder**: JOHN SMITH  \n  - **Installments**: 1  \n- **Amount**: 1,718 USD  \n- **Creation Date**: April 20, 2025  \n- **Provider**: STRIPE  \n- **Order ID**: 1ad449c5-484f-42ed-a768-96846e746808  \n\n**Transaction Details**:  \n- **Transaction Status**: Succeeded  \n- **Provider Transaction Number**: T-357233-19f3481f-1d90-486d-9897-724e941e10d8  \n\nNo information is available in the sandbox environment for this ID.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\n```\n\n### Payouts answer example\n\n```\nHere’s the full information for the payout with ID `1a0e03d8-73eb-465b-b40f-f6746658d784` in the production environment:\n\n- **Payout Status**: SUCCEEDED  \n- **Payout Sub-status**: SUCCEEDED  \n\n- **Amount**:  \n  - **Value**: 37.84 USD  \n\n- **Purpose**: PERSONAL TRANSFER  \n- **Description**: CharityPlatform payout ID 40670325 for user ID 2671355  \n- **Merchant Reference Code**: payout-40670325  \n- **Currency**: USD  \n- **Created At**: 2025-04-30T05:27:37.397038Z  \n- **Updated At**: 2025-04-30T05:27:39.388616Z  \n- **Beneficiary Code**: 2671355  \n- **Beneficiary Country**: US (United States)  \n\n- **Withdrawal Method**:  \n  - **Method Type**: Debit Card  \n  - **Card Brand**: MASTERCARD  \n  - **Card Category**: DEBIT MASTERCARD NON-EMBOSSED  \n  - **Cardholder Name**: JANE DOE  \n  - **Issuing Bank**: BANK OF AMERICA  \n  - **Issuing Country Code**: US\n```\n\n### Subscription answer example\n\n```\n- **Code**: 8bc1900a-0341-4e15-b841-556ce40b1233  \n- **Name**: StreamMax Monthly\n- **Description**: Premium Streaming Subscription  \n- **Status**: ACTIVE  \n- **Country**: US  \n- **Created At**: 2024-11-29T22:20:46Z  \n- **Updated At**: 2025-04-30T17:20:46Z  \n\n**Amount & Billing:**  \n- **Currency**: USD  \n- **Amount**: 9.99  \n- **Billing Cycle (Current)**: 6  \n- **Next Billing Cycle**: 2025-05-30T17:20:46Z  \n\n**Frequency & Payments:**  \n- **Frequency**: Every 1 MONTH  \n- **Payments**:  \n  - Payment 1: 42266ea1-098e-4530-a630-14155a582196  \n  - Payment 2: a381fa15-eb1f-4a3f-83b4-4d4735daf98f  \n  - Payment 3: c5014bb2-5be8-444f-b689-9f32223b4bfd  \n  - Payment 4: 182dea88-a2d6-4456-b6ad-32d0d4282665  \n  - Payment 5: 6a4b44f7-419e-4aaf-a816-01214ef0baae  \n\n**Payment Method:**  \n- **Type**: CARD  \n- **Vaulted Token**: 7d182868-8886-4ba5-9dfb-d0ad56aa1b54  \n\n**Retries:**  \n- **Number of Retries**: 6  \n- **Retry on Decline**: False  \n\nIf you need further details or have any other questions, feel free to ask!\n```\n\n### Payment answer link example\n\n```\nHere are the details for the payment link with code `6370130d-19d5-31e3-b0e5-bc612a31e1e8` in the production environment:\n\n- **Account Code**: e4f11f90-f87d-45d4-b1c5-e63bf251f33d  \n- **Amount**: 200.00 USD  \n- **Capture**: True  \n- **Checkout URL**: [Visit Checkout](https://checkout.y.uno/payment?session=4c7290ed-95da-40ba-9278-816f90e14624)  \n- **Country**: United States (US)  \n- **Created At**: 2025-04-16T16:49:27.171169Z  \n- **Description**: Test Purchase  \n- **One Time Use**: True  \n- **Organization Code**: cb2960f5-c3e1-4c09-86ab-55506240394f  \n- **Payment Method Types**: CARD, GOOGLE_PAY, CLICK_TO_PAY, APPLE_PAY, BANK_TRANSFER  \n- **Payments Number**: 0  \n- **Split Payment Methods**: False  \n- **Start At**: 2025-04-16T16:49:25.818Z  \n- **Status**: CREATED  \n- **Timezone**: GMT-4 America/New_York  \n\nNo information was found for the sandbox environment.\n\nIf there's anything else you'd like to know or need further assistance, feel free to ask!\n```\n\n## Webhook & system information\n\nAida makes it easy to monitor and validate webhook activity by showing whether webhooks were **configured** in Yuno, **received** by Yuno from the provider, and **successfully sent** to the merchant, along with key transaction and delivery details.\n\n**Note:** **Received** means Yuno successfully received the webhook from the provider.\n\n### 1.

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/network-tokens", "title": "Network Tokens", "content_markdown": "# Network Tokens\n\nNetwork tokens represent a significant advancement in the payment processing industry, acting as digital surrogates for sensitive payment card details, including credit card numbers. Issued by payment networks such as Visa, Mastercard, and American Express, these tokens are at the forefront of enhancing transaction security within our evolving digital landscape.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/12b72d4-desktop_Network_token_2.png)\n\n### Benefits of network tokens\n\n* **Enhanced security**: By replacing actual card data during transactions, network tokens play a crucial role in strengthening security measures, significantly reducing the risk of exposure to potential fraud.\n* **Seamless integration**: With minimal integration efforts adhering to EMVCo's network token standards, our solution ensures a seamless and efficient implementation process, allowing for quick adaptation within various payment scenarios.\n* **Automatic updates**: Network tokens, managed and updated automatically by card networks, contribute to a reduction in shopper friction and declined payments. This inherent adaptability ensures a higher authorization rate compared to transactions without network tokens.\n\n## One-time use token vs vaulted token vs network token\n\n| One-time use token | Vaulted token | Network token |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| While using Yuno's SDK, we gather all the necessary information to process the payment and store it in a one-time use token, regardless of the customer's chosen payment method. You will use the token when creating the payment. Note that this token only works one time. You will need to generate a new one-time token for each checkout session created. | A vaulted token is created by Yuno once a payment method is enrolled and stored with the customer information. You can use the created vaulted token to identify the payment method in future payments. | Digitized representations of sensitive payment card information, such as credit card numbers, issued by major payment networks like Visa, Mastercard, or American Express. These tokens serve the purpose of substituting actual card data in transactions, thereby enhancing security by minimizing exposure to potential fraudulent activities. |\n\nWhen the network tokens feature is enabled, Yuno generates network tokens for all cards enrolled and securely stored in our vault. This approach is fully aligned with how network tokenization is intended to work, as defined by Visa and Mastercard after the card validation — ensuring better performance, security, and reliability in recurring and future transactions. Cards not stored in Yuno — such as one-time use cards — are naturally excluded from this process, since network tokenization is not applicable in those cases.\n\n## Network tokens lifecycle\n\nNetwork tokens can have the statuses described in the section below.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/654f542-Image_-_nico2.png)\n\n| Status | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Created | The initial status of a network token that has been created. |\n| Active | The network token is active and can be used to make a payment. |\n| Suspended | Tokens may be suspended if the cardholder contacts the issuer and requests that payments from a particular merchant be blocked. |\n| Canceled | Tokens may be canceled for various reasons, such as the cardholder account associated with the token being closed. |\n\n## Types of integration\n\nTo make payments with network tokens, you have two available options:\n\n1. Let Yuno provision and collect network tokens.\n2. Use your existing network tokens.\n\n### 1. Let Yuno provision and collect network tokens\n\nWe procure network tokens from leading card networks, including Visa, Mastercard, and American Express. These tokens are securely stored within the Yuno infrastructure and are used instead of the actual cards during the authorization process.\n\nThere is no need for additional integration to access the benefits of network tokenization when Yuno manages the solicitation and accumulation of tokens on your behalf. Simply follow the standard payment workflow corresponding to your specific card payment integration. Yuno seamlessly handles the process, substituting card details for a network token, resulting in increased authorization rates.\n\nTo activate payments using network tokens, please contact our support team to provision or request the necessary credentials.\n\n#### Response example\n\nDuring either the enrollment or payment creation, you will receive the basic information of the network token used in the corresponding operation.\n\nJSON\n\n```\n{\n    \"description\": \"Test\",\n    \"account_id\": \"{{account-code}}\",\n    \"merchant_order_id\": \"0000023\",\n    \"country\": \"DE\",\n    \"merchant_reference\" : \"reference-{{$randomUUID}}\",\n    \"amount\": {\n        \"currency\": \"EUR\",\n        \"value\": 5000\n    },\n    \"customer_payer\": {\n        \"id\":\"967ecd18-d898-4b88-9400-dd5b01b18edc\"\n    },\n    \"workflow\": \"DIRECT\",\n    \"payment_method\": {\n        \"type\":\"CARD\",\n        \"vaulted_token\": \"61d49d6e-7c0e-49d0-be79-7eb08871f998\",\n        \"detail\": {\n           \"card\": {\n               \"network_token\":{\n                  \"network\":\"MASTERCARD\",\n                  \"status\": \"ACTIVE\",\n                  \"par\":\"V0010014622074319305424002620\",\n                  \"token_data\":{\n                    \"iin\":\"45079900\",\n                    \"lfd\": \"0010\",\n                    \"expiration_month\":\"10\",\n                    \"expiration_year\":\"2028\",\n                    \"response\":{\n                      \"code\":\"succeeded\",\n                      \"message\": \"Transaction Succeeded\"\n                    }\n                  }\n              }\n           }\n        }\n    }\n  [...]\n}\n```\n\n### 2- Use your existing network tokens\n\nAfter setting up the necessary credentials in your Yuno account and contacting our support team, you will be ready to execute tokenized transactions seamlessly.\n\n> ❗️\n>\n> With this option, Yuno acts only as a passthrough for the network token information. The merchant must provide the necessary information about the network tokens so Yuno can share them with upstream payment partners.\n\nNetwork token transactions utilize existing payment transaction API requests. Similar to creating a payment with credit card details, when a merchant uses the Yuno API to finalize a payment, they can choose to include the \"network\\_token\" object to use a network token for the transaction.\n\n#### Payment request fields\n\nAlong with the `card_data` object, these fields should be added to the `payment_method.detail.card.network_token.token_data` object for sending payments using Yuno's API.\n\n| Field | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `number` | number | [Mandatory] - Token's number without any separators.

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/payouts", "title": "Payouts", "content_markdown": "# Payouts\n\nYuno Payouts is an API solution designed to streamline the process of sending secure payouts to various beneficiaries, such as users, merchants, providers, and customers. With Yuno Payouts, you can efficiently distribute funds to multiple recipients while ensuring their security and taking complete control of your payout operations.\n\nThe Yuno Payout solution enables you to create payout requests without restrictions on the number of records. You can perform payouts to any bank, card, or wallet. The payout options are only limited by the provider you choose to use.\n\n## Benefits of using Yuno Payouts\n\n* **Centralization**: The Payout service saves you time and costs by centralizing all your payment operations in one place. You no longer need to manage payments across multiple systems or interfaces.\n* **Information** : Stay informed about payment statuses with our customizable notifications. You can receive real-time updates on any changes in the payment order status tailored to your preferences.\n* **Localization**: By depositing funds directly into your partners' local bank accounts, you can pay them in their preferred currency, eliminating the need for foreign currency conversions and saving them from extra fees and taxes.\n\n## How Payouts work\n\nA payout in Yuno can go through a few different states, starting with its creation. When you create a payout, it automatically receives the **CREATED** status. However, the **CREATED** status is temporary. As Yuno checks and transfers the information to the provider, the payout status changes to **PENDING**.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/9b3d5c1-Driagram-yuno.png)\n\nWhen the payout changes to the **PENDING** status, a series of actions are performed, defining if the payout will succeed, transfer the funds, or if it will be blocked. Below, you find the description for each of the possible ending states:\n\n* **SUCCEEDED**: The provider validates the transaction, and the funds are successfully transferred to the beneficiary’s account. You'll receive a confirmation notification.\n* **REJECTED**: The payout was not processed due to problems Yuno identified before attempting the transfer. Possible reasons for a rejected payout include insufficient funds or incorrect payout details, like a wrong account number. You'll need to create a new payout to perform the transaction.\n* **DECLINED**: The payout was attempted, but the provider refused to accept it. Reasons for a declined payout include a frozen or closed beneficiary account or the transaction being flagged as a potential fraud. You'll need to create a new payout to perform the transaction.\n\nLearn more about the payout status on the [Payouts Status](/reference/payout-workflow) page.\n\n## New Concepts\n\n* **Beneficiary**: This is equivalent to the customer for payins. It is the object that receives beneficiary information for the payout. Example: If the payout is for salary payments, the beneficiary would be the employee receiving their salary.\n* **Withdrawal Method**: Similar to Payins, where information for the corresponding payment method must be completed for the payment, in payouts, information for the withdrawal method to be used for the payout must be completed. Within this, the corresponding information must be sent depending on the category of the withdrawal method, which can be cards, bank transfers, or wallets.\n\n## Using Yuno Payouts\n\nThe Yuno Payouts feature is available through Yuno API. You can use the API to create and retrieve payout information. To use the Payouts solution, you need to fulfill the following requirements:\n\n* You need a Yuno account.\n* You need to integrate with [Yuno API](/reference/create-payout).\n* Have an account with an external provider that supports payouts.\n\nTo use the Payouts solution, you'll need to follow the steps below:\n\n1. Configure the provider credentials in the [Connections section](../docs/connections) in your Yuno dashboard.\n   1. [Optional] - And a [Webhook URL](../docs/configure-webhooks) to get notifications about updates with the payout transactions.\n2. Create the payout using the [Create Payout](/reference/create-payout) endpoint. You need to provide the beneficiary information, the amount, and the withdrawal method to make the payout.\n3. Yuno will verify the information and then send the payout request to the provider. The provider will analyze the available funds to authorize the payment.\n4. To check the current status of payouts, you can use one of the following options:\n   * The [Retrieve Payout by ID](/reference/retrieve-payout-by-id) endpoint, informing the `id` received after creating the payout.\n   * The [Retrieve Payout by Merchant Reference](/reference/retrieve-payout-by-merchant-reference) endpoint, informing the `merchant_reference` provided when creating the payout.\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Yuno Payouts availability\n>\n> Yuno Payouts requires a security and risk analysis. To learn more about the Yuno Payouts, check the provider's support or request the activation, contact [Yuno's support team](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a9dadcd9d9c6dbdde9d087dcc7c6).\n\n## Referenced Payouts\n\nPayouts could be made to different payment methods, such as bank accounts and even card, depending on the provider. For Payouts to a card payment method where the merchant does not have the credit card information (not being PCI compliant) Yuno lets them send the Payout if the card was previously used in a payment. This is called a \"Referenced Payout\".\n\nIn order to be able to use this, you'll need to first charge the customer using one of our PCI compliant solutions (Any [Yuno SDK](/docs/yuno-sdks)) and then make a Payout indicating the original transaction where we can find the credit card information.\n\nJSON\n\n```\n\"withdrawal_method\": {\n    \"type\": \"STP_PAYOUT\",\n    \"provider_id\": \"STP\",\n    \"original_transaction_id\":\"9104911d-5df9-429e-8488-ad41abea1a4b\"\n  }\n```\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Cancel and Capture Flow](/docs/Cancel-and-capture-flow)[Chargeback Management](/docs/chargeback-management)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Benefits of using Yuno Payouts](#benefits-of-using-yuno-payouts)\n  + [How Payouts work](#how-payouts-work)\n  + [New Concepts](#new-concepts)\n  + [Using Yuno Payouts](#using-yuno-payouts)\n  + [Referenced Payouts](#referenced-payouts)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/9b3d5c1-Driagram-yuno.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/9b3d5c1-Driagram-yuno.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a diagram showing the different types of the system"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/currency-conversion", "title": "Currency Conversion", "content_markdown": "# Currency Conversion\n\n## Introduction\n\nYuno's currency conversion service allows you to settle payments in both your currency and your customer's. Currency conversion is the process of converting one currency into another. It involves using exchange rates to determine the equivalent amount in the target currency.\n\n### Benefits\n\n* **Global Reach**: Allows businesses to operate internationally by accepting and making payments in multiple currencies.\n* **Customer Convenience**: Customers can pay in their preferred currency, enhancing their buying experiences.\n* **Cost Efficiency**: Optimizing conversion rates can reduce transaction costs.\n* **Revenue Optimization**: Businesses can leverage favorable exchange rates to maximize profits.\n\n### Some use Cases\n\n* **E-commerce Platforms**: Online stores that sell products internationally use currency conversion to display prices in local currencies and process payments accordingly.\n* **Remittance Services**: Companies that facilitate money transfers across borders rely on currency conversion to ensure recipients receive funds in their local currency.\n* **Travel and Hospitality**: Businesses in this sector use currency conversion to handle payments from international travelers.\n* **Investment Platforms**: Fintech platforms that offer trading in foreign stocks, bonds, or cryptocurrencies use currency conversion to manage investments across different currencies.\n\n## Implementation\n\nIn Yuno, we connect different currency conversion providers, so you dont have to worry about the differences between each integration. The implementation of the service is going to depend on the currency conversion provider you choose to work with.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n* **Exchange Rate**: The rate at which one currency can be exchanged for another. This can be a fixed rate or a floating rate that fluctuates based on market conditions.\n* **Base Currency**: The currency you are converting from.\n* **Cardholder Currency**: The currency you are converting to.\n* **Conversion Spread**: The difference between the buy and sell rates, representing the profit margin for the entity providing the conversion service.\n* **Real-Time Conversion**: Using up-to-date exchange rates to perform conversions at the exact time of the transaction.\n\n### API implementation\n\nIn order to be able to use the currency conversion service you have two API implementations available.\n\n#### Provider's rate service\n\nThe merchant can use the currency conversion service of an external provider and send the corresponding information directly in the payment in Yuno. In order to use this, please contact your technical account manager to make sure that the information is set properly.\n\nExample:\n\nJSON\n\n```\n \"amount\": {\n        \"currency\": \"COP\",\n        \"value\": 5000, \n        \"currency_conversion\": {\n            \"provider_currency_conversion_id\": \"AAA01SADOIAJSDLAKSJM\",\n            \"cardholder_currency\": \"ARS\",\n            \"cardholder_amount\": 1146.55    \n        }\n    }\n```\n\n#### Yuno's rate service\n\nAlso, the merchant can use directly the [currency conversion service of Yuno](/reference/currency-conversion) that gets the information from the provider of their choosing and send in the creation of the payment the id of the conversion rate query and the amount data accordingly. In case of using this service, you will also need to send the id obtained in the payment request so we can link the information. Example:\n\nRate service\n\n```\n{\n  \"account_id\": \"fe14c7c6-c75e-43b7-bdbe-4c87ad52c482\",\n  \"amount\": {\n    \"currency_conversion\": {\n      \"cardholder_currency\": \"USD\",\n      \"provider_data\": {\n        \"id\": \"CIBC\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"value\": 10000,\n    \"currency\": \"COP\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPayment\n\n```\n    \"amount\": {\n        \"currency\": \"COP\",\n        \"value\": 5000, \n        \"currency_conversion\": {\n            \"id\": \"62fdcd6c-50ea-4640-985b-5656010fe5fD\",\n            \"cardholder_currency\": \"ARS\",\n            \"cardholder_amount\": 1146.55    \n        }\n    },\n```\n\nIn order to use this, please **contact your technical account manager** to make sure that the information is set properly.\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Card Account Updater](/docs/card-account-updater)[Enviroments](/docs/enviroments)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Introduction](#introduction)\n  + - [Benefits](#benefits)\n    - [Some use Cases](#some-use-cases)\n  + [Implementation](#implementation)\n  + - [Key Concepts](#key-concepts)\n    - [API implementation](#api-implementation)", "images": [], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

Our machine-ready documentation makes it easier for large language models (LLMs) to understand Yuno’s APIs and documentation, while our Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a seamless way to integrate Yuno's capabilities into your product.\n\nThis guide introduces how to work with both components. You’ll learn how the LLM layer empowers AI tools to deliver more accurate and contextual integration support, and how the MCP can embed key payment and merchant functionality directly into your environment, enabling faster builds with less friction.\n\n## Machine-ready content in plain text\n\nTo help large language models understand and support Yuno integrations, we provide a dedicated set of Markdown (.md) files designed specifically for machine readability. These files describe Yuno’s APIs, product behavior, and implementation details in a format that’s easy for LLMs to parse and analyze.\n\nThe .md files are part of [Yuno Docs](https://docs.y.uno/). You can access them by adding .md to the end of any Yuno Docs URL (this works for both Guides and API Reference pages). The content is served in plain text, making it easier for machines to extract and process the underlying knowledge without requiring human interpretation.\n\nThis setup enables AI assistants, developer tools, and chat-based agents to answer questions, explain features, and guide integrations automatically. It’s a lightweight but powerful way to open up Yuno’s documentation to a wide range of intelligent applications.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> Looking for a managed, network-accessible MCP endpoint with IP binding, rate limits, and session TTLs?

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/exporting-tokens-from-yuno", "title": "Exporting Tokens from Yuno", "content_markdown": "# Exporting Tokens from Yuno\n\nYuno offers a secure and PCI DSS-compliant process to export tokens from our vault to your systems, or a third-party provider. This guide explains the requirements, encryption protocols, data format, and delivery method to ensure safe and compliant migration of sensitive card data.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Security Requirements\n>\n> Token export requests are handled with the same level of rigor and encryption used to protect data in production. Only eligible clients with validated use cases and PCI DSS compliance may initiate this process.\n\n## When to request a token export\n\nYou may request an export of your tokenized data from Yuno when:\n\n* You are switching to a different payment processor or tokenization provider.\n* You need to manage tokens within your own PCI DSS-certified infrastructure.\n\n## Eligibility and prerequisites\n\nTo proceed with an export, the following conditions must be met in this order:\n\n### 1. Formal request\n\nThe client must submit a written request that includes:\n\n* A formal request from the third party who wants to receive the merchant data\n* Authorization to export the tokenized data.\n* Confirmation of the recipient (internal team or third-party provider).\n* Legal and compliance approval on the client's side.\n\nPlease submit this written request to your primary Yuno point of contact, and also send a copy via email to [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0477616771766d707d29696d637665706d6b6a77447d2a716a6b) to ensure both teams are informed.\n\n### 2. PCI DSS certification\n\nSince the exported data contains card data, the receiving entity must be certified under PCI DSS. This certification is required regardless of whether you are:\n\n* Switching to a different payment provider\n* Requesting your own data for internal use\n\nWe require:\n\n* A valid Attestation of Compliance (AOC) from the receiving entity\n* The AOC must be current and valid at the time of the export request\n\n### 3. Technical requirements for secure data transfer\n\nAfter the formal request is approved and PCI DSS compliance is verified, the following technical requirements must be met:\n\n#### a. PGP public key for encryption\n\nThe receiving entity must provide a PGP public key to encrypt the exported files. This ensures that the data remains secure both in transit and at rest.\n\n* The receiving entity must submit the key\n* Yuno will validate the key format and compatibility\n\n#### b. SFTP access credentials\n\nYuno will provision access to a secure Yuno-hosted SFTP server. To do this, we'll need:\n\n* A static IP address from which the file will be accessed\n* An SSH public key for authentication\n* We'll create a dedicated SFTP user account for this purpose\n\n## File format\n\nThe exported file will be encrypted using the provided PGP key and follow the structure below:\n\n| Field | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `holder_name` | Name of the cardholder |\n| `number` | Primary Account Number (PAN) |\n| `token` | Token stored in Yuno's vault |\n| `expiration_year` | Expiration year of the card |\n| `expiration_month` | Expiration month of the card |\n\n* The file will be formatted as a `.csv`\n* All fields are UTF-8 encoded.\n\n## Secure delivery process\n\nOnce all prerequisites are met:\n\n1. Yuno's security team will:\n\n   * Prepare the export file with the card data\n   * Encrypt the file using the provided PGP key\n   * Create the SFTP user account for file retrieval\n   * Upload the file to the secure SFTP location\n2. You will be notified when:\n\n   * The file is ready for download\n   * The SFTP access is configured\n   * The access window is active\n3. You can then:\n\n   * Access the secure SFTP location using your SSH key and whitelisted IP\n   * Download the encrypted file within the defined time window\n   * The file will be automatically removed from the server after the access window expires\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Secure Channel Required\n>\n> The file is never sent by email or made publicly accessible. Access is strictly limited to the configured secure channel.\n\n## Security and compliance\n\nYuno is certified under PCI DSS Level 1 and adheres to strict encryption, access control, and data retention practices throughout this process.\n\nWe ensure that:\n\n* All exports are logged and monitored.\n* Only authorized personnel handle encrypted data.\n* Files are never stored longer than the required access window.\n\nUpdated 5 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Via API](/docs/via-api)[VTEX](/docs/vtex)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [When to request a token export](#when-to-request-a-token-export)\n  + [Eligibility and prerequisites](#eligibility-and-prerequisites)\n  + - [1.

Whether running a SaaS application, a content platform, or an e-commerce store, Yuno's service can help you handle subscription-related tasks efficiently.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### **Subscriptions vs Stored Credentials**\n>\n> * **Subscriptions** (this page): Yuno's recurrence engine. You provide instructions and frequency once, then Yuno automatically sends transactions on your behalf.\n> * **Stored Credentials**: You control the recurrence. You're responsible for sending each transaction according to your own schedule. See [Stored Credentials](/docs/stored-credentials).\n\n## Benefits of using Yuno subscriptions\n\n* **Recurring revenue**: Subscriptions provide a steady and predictable income stream, which can help stabilize cash flow and reduce financial uncertainties.\n* **Customer loyalty**: Subscribers tend to be more loyal, resulting in higher customer retention rates and reduced churn.\n* **Reduced acquisition costs**: Subscriptions reduce the need for constant customer acquisition efforts, allowing businesses to focus more on retaining and serving existing customers.\n\n## Yuno subscriptions\n\nA subscription in Yuno's environment can go through several stages, starting with its creation status. When a subscription is created, it automatically receives the **CREATED** status. However, it is a transitory status that is active while the payment isn't processed. After that, the subscription will be **ACTIVE** or **CANCELLED**, depending on the payment confirmation.\n\nWhen the payment related to the subscription is confirmed, the subscription status changes to **ACTIVE**. It remains with this status while the subscription is within its availability data range and the customer pays the bills. An active subscription can change to three different statuses:\n\n* **COMPLETED**: The subscription finish date was reached. In this case, the current subscription is terminated, and it is not possible to reactivate it. If your client wants to continue using your product/service using recurring payments, you need to create a new subscription.\n* **PAUSED**: At any moment, you can pause the subscription. Use this option in case your customer has delayed a payment, for example. You can always activate a paused subscription.\n* **CANCELLED**: If your customer decides to cancel the recurring payment, you can cancel the subscription. After canceling it, the subscription is terminated, and it is not possible to reactivate it.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/47919b9-image.png)\n\nLearn more about the status of the subscription on the [Subscription Status](/reference/status-subscriptions) page.\n\n## Subscription integration\n\nTo start using the subscriptions feature, you need a Yuno account and integration with the Yuno API. The Yuno API provides the following operations to manage your subscriptions:\n\n* **Create**: Use the [Create a Subscription endpoint](/reference/Create-Subscription) to subscribe a customer.\n* **Pause**: Pause an active subscription with the [Pause Subscription endpoint](/reference/Pause-Subscription).\n* **Resume**: Resume a previously paused subscription with the [Resume Subscription endpoint](/reference/Resume-Subscription).\n* **Cancel**: Cancel an active subscription with the [Cancel Subscription endpoint](/reference/Cancel-Subscription).\n* **Retrieve**: Use the [Retrieve Subscription endpoint](/reference/Retrieve-Subscription) to get the details of a subscription.\n\n## New concepts\n\n* **Subscriptions**: A subscription involves recurring charges directly tied to a customer and a particular payment method. When stopping or updating, the impact is solely on the same.\n* **Payment methods available**\n  + **Enrolled**: Customers can pay with a previously enrolled payment method. Only the vaulted token is needed when creating the subscription to associate it with the charges.\n* **Capabilities**:\n  + **Frequency**: Define the frequency at which subscription charges will occur, whether daily, weekly, or monthly, specifying the amount that needs to be charged for the next billing cycle.\n  + **Billing cycles**: The number of billing cycles (following the frequency criterion) that will be completed to fulfill the subscription. If neither an end\\_date is sent nor defined, we will continue attempting charges until it is stopped.\n  + **Billing date**: By specifying the billing\\_date object, the merchant can define the logic behind the exact date for the billing of the subscription. This is mutually exclusive with the frequency object.\n  + **Availability**: The start and end dates of the subscription. If they are not defined, nor the billing cycles, charges will continue until it is stopped.\n    - The fields billing\\_cycles and availability.finish\\_at impact each other. If both are completed during the subscription creation, it will transition to the COMPLETED state upon reaching the nearest event defined in these fields, whether it is the billing cycle or the corresponding finish\\_at.\n  + **Trial periods**: This feature lets you define a period where your customers can benefit from a reduced amount. It could be partial or total (for example, a free trial). You need to determine the value to be reduced from the total amount of each subscription charge and the billing cycles it should apply to.\n  + **Initial payment validation**: A flag to identify if the subscription should wait for the first payment to continue. False by default. If the field is set to true, the subscription should remain in the CREATED status while waiting for the first payment of the subscription.\n    - If the first payment succeeds (SUCCEEDED), the subscription transitions to ACTIVE.\n    - If the first payment fails (DECLINED/REJECTED), the subscription transitions to CANCELED.\n\n## Using Yuno subscription solution\n\nYuno provides subscription management functionalities through its API. You can use this API to create, update, and manage subscriptions, as well as retrieve subscription details and usage.\n\nTo use the subscription solution, normally, you will follow the steps described below:\n\n1. To begin, [Create a Customer](/reference/Create-Customer). You will need to provide personal customer information and the **merchant\\_customer\\_id**, a unique identifier for the customer used in your system. Upon completing the customer creation process, you will receive an **id** that identifies the user within the Yuno system. This **id** will be used to create the subscription.\n2. After creating the customer, you will need to [enroll a credit card](/docs/enroll-payment-methods) to generate a **vaulted\\_token** for use in the subscription creation.\n3. [Create a Subscription](/reference/Create-Subscription) for your customer and the enrolled card. At this step, you will configure the subscription and define the payment method. When creating the subscription, you can customize:\n   * The amount the subscription charges.\n   * The billing frequency (daily, monthly, or yearly).\n   * The total number of billing cycles.\n   * The subscription availability to define the start and end date.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Available Payment Methods\n>\n> Currently, only Cards can be used as payment methods for subscriptions.\n\n> ❗️\n>\n> ### Declined Payments\n>\n> If a payment from a subscription is declined (including the first payment attempt), the subscription will continue its schedule for future payment attempts, giving the merchant the possibility to charge the client the pending amount through a different process and continue with the ongoing subscription. If you want to cancel a subscription, feel free to use the [cancel subscription endpoint](/reference/cancel-subscription).\n\nIn the response to the [Create Subscription](/reference/Create-Subscription) endpoint, you receive an `id` which is used to identify the created subscription. You will use the `id` if you decide to pause, resume, or cancel the subscription.\n\nUpdated about 1 month ago\n\n---\n\n[Provider Installments](/docs/provider-installments)[Smart Retries](/docs/retries)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Benefits of using Yuno subscriptions](#benefits-of-using-yuno-subscriptions)\n  + [Yuno subscriptions](#yuno-subscriptions)\n  + [Subscription integration](#subscription-integration)\n  + [New concepts](#new-concepts)\n  + [Using Yuno subscription solution](#using-yuno-subscription-solution)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/47919b9-image.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/47919b9-image.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a diagram showing the different types of the different types of the system"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}
{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/google-pay-direct-integration", "title": "Direct Integration", "content_markdown": "# Direct Integration\n\n> ❗️\n>\n> ### **SDK Required**\n>\n> Google Pay Direct integration requires using one of Yuno's SDKs (Web, Android, or iOS) for implementation. This feature cannot be implemented without an SDK integration.\n\nThis page provides instructions for connecting and offering Google Pay™ as a payment option to your customers using the Direct integration.\n\n## Requirements\n\nBefore starting the Google Pay integration process, ensure that Google Pay is available in your country. Use the [Google Pay support page](https://support.google.com/googlepay/answer/12429287?hl=en) to verify support for your operating countries.\n\nNext, check which processors are available by reviewing the [participating processors](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/) on Google's site.\n\nAll merchants must comply with the Google Pay APIs [Acceptable Use Policy](https://payments.developers.google.com/terms/aup), accept the [Google Pay API Terms of Service](https://payments.developers.google.com/terms/sellertos), and register with the [Google Pay Business Console](https://pay.google.com/business/console) to obtain a Google merchant ID. Complete the Google Pay and Wallet Console configuration by following these steps:\n\n1. Complete the **Business Profile**\n2. Review the information required in **Google Pay API** > **Integrate with your website**:\n\n   * Your website – This must exactly match the domain of your hosted checkout page (with or without \"www\")\n   * Integration type – **GATEWAY**\n3. Screenshots:\n\n* Payment method screen – Your hosted checkout page\n* Google Pay API payment screen – The Google Pay payment sheet (shown after clicking the GPay button)\n* Post-purchase screen – Transaction confirmation page\n* Submit the screenshots, indicate that you have submitted the request, and share the merchantId (BCR)\n\nUse the assigned Merchant ID to configure the Google Pay connection in the Yuno dashboard.\n\n## Integration\n\nTo integrate Google Pay with Yuno, follow these steps:\n\n1. In the [Yuno dashboard](https://dashboard.y.uno/), go to the Connections tab. Find Google Pay and click Connect. Enter your credentials in the side panel. Choose a name for the connection and use the merchant ID obtained from the [Google Pay Business Console](https://pay.google.com/business/console) in the Merchant ID field.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/2fee3d1-google-pay1.png)\n\n2. Create a route in Yuno's dashboard using the processor you want for Google Pay payments. See the [Configure dynamic routing](/docs/routing#configuring-the-dynamic-routing) guide for more information.\n3. Integrate [Yuno's SDK](../docs/android-sdk-integrations) into your app to ensure a smooth connection between your application and Yuno's platform. [Example](https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-android).\n   1. **Authorization methods available**: Yuno supports all authorization methods (purchase, authorization, capture), but availability depends on each provider.\n4. Enable Google Pay as a payment method in your [Yuno Checkout builder](../docs/checkout-builder) so customers can use it during checkout.\n\nOnce these integration steps are complete, Google Pay will be seamlessly offered to your customers via the Yuno checkout. Customers will be able to select Google Pay and authorize payments using their familiar Google Pay interface. Yuno then securely handles the payment token received from Google, processing the transaction through your configured payment processor. All Google Pay transactions will be visible and manageable within your Yuno dashboard alongside your other payment methods, providing a unified view of your operations.\n\n## Enable and test Google Pay with Yuno\n\nAfter integrating, you can enable and test Google Pay with Yuno as follows:\n\n1. Create a Google Wallet Test Account:\n   * Visit the [Google Wallet Test Account Sign-In](https://accounts.google.com/InteractiveLogin/signinchooser?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fpay.google.com%2Fbusiness%2Fconsole%2F&followup=https%3A%2F%2Fpay.google.com%2Fbusiness%2Fconsole%2F&osid=1&passive=1209600&ifkv=AeDOFXjl_LLJZyuykU06uleha4p7uSXJNnLCv_n2jshX6QVJYCy9AKq3K28mIfpgyfS2NDHfimnAFg&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=ServiceLogin) page.\n   * If you do not have a Google account, create one to proceed.\n   * Once signed in, you will be redirected to the Google Wallet business console.\n2. Access the Google Wallet API Section:\n   * In the Google Wallet business console, navigate to the API management or integration section (usually under developer or integration settings).\n3. Select **Create a Pass** to enable **Demo Mode**:\n   * In the Google Wallet API section, find the option labeled **Create a Pass**.\n   * Click this option to enable **Demo mode**. This allows you to simulate and test pass creation and interactions without real transactions.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/fbc51b7-6847ef9-demo_mode.png)\n\n4. Download the [Google Wallet App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel&hl=en&gl=US) from the Play Store.\n5. Go through the payment flow to test the integration.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure Google Pay is integrated and working as expected before making it available to your customers.\n\n## Go live\n\nAfter completing all integration steps in the testing environment, request [Google Production Access](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/guides/test-and-deploy/request-prod-access) and contact your Technical Account Manager. The Yuno team will help verify your configuration and confirm you are ready to go live.\n\n## Implementation details\n\nKey details for your Google Pay integration with Yuno:\n\n### Google Pay API authorization methods\n\nYuno supports both Google Pay API authorization methods:\n\n* **`PAN_ONLY`**: Card credentials stored in the user's Google account. When used, Yuno automatically handles 3D Secure authentication if enabled.\n* **`CRYPTOGRAM_3DS`**: Device-based card credentials with built-in authentication. These credentials include cryptographic authentication and don't require additional 3DS processing.\n\nBoth methods are supported globally across all countries where Yuno operates. On the frontend, include both `PAN_ONLY` and `CRYPTOGRAM_3DS` in your `allowedAuthMethods` array for maximum payment success rates.\n\n* **3D Secure (3DS) for`PAN_ONLY` credentials**: If Google Pay returns a `PAN_ONLY` credential (a card stored in the user's Google account), Yuno will automatically handle the 3D Secure authentication flow if 3DS is enabled. On the frontend, make sure your Google Pay API request includes `PAN_ONLY` in the `allowedAuthMethods` array.\n* **Gateway and GatewayMerchantID configuration**: When registering with the [Google Pay Business Console](https://pay.google.com/business/console), ensure that under **Google Pay API** > **Integrate with your website**, the **Integration type** is set to **GATEWAY**. The `Merchant ID` from the Google Pay Business Console is used in the \"Merchant ID\" field when setting up the Google Pay connection in the Yuno dashboard. Set `gateway` to `yuno` and use your assigned Merchant ID as the `gatewayMerchantId` in your Google Pay API configuration.\n* **Authorization methods**: Yuno supports standard authorization methods (purchase, authorization, capture). Availability depends on the payment processor and acquiring bank for each country and payment.\n* **Billing address requirements**: If your payment processing requires the customer's billing address (e.g., for AVS checks), configure this in your Google Pay API request. Google provides `BillingAddressParameters` to specify the required detail (e.g., MIN or FULL). See [Google's documentation](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/reference/request-objects#BillingAddressParameters). Only request billing address details if necessary, as this can increase checkout friction.\n* **Transaction data and payment cryptography**: Merchants integrate Yuno's SDKs (Android, iOS, Web) into their applications. When a customer chooses Google Pay, Yuno's SDK interacts with the Google Pay API and securely receives the encrypted payment data (payment token) from Google. This token is passed from your app to your backend server, which then uses Yuno's server-side APIs to submit the token for payment processing. Yuno handles decryption and processing with the payment processor.\n\n## Additional information\n\nFor further questions about the integration process, contact Yuno support or consult:\n\n* [Web documentation](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/guides/setup) and [integration checklist](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/guides/test-and-deploy/integration-checklist)\n* [Android documentation](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/overview) and [integration checklist](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/guides/test-and-deploy/integration-checklist)\n\nGoogle provides brand guides for including the Google Pay brand in your website or app:\n\n* [Web](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/web/guides/brand-guidelines)\n* [Android](https://developers.google.com/pay/api/android/guides/brand-guidelines)\n\n### Card networks supported\n\nThe card networks supported worldwide are AMEX, DISCOVER, JCB, MASTERCARD, and VISA. For Brazil, supported networks are VISA, ELECTRON, MASTERCARD, MAESTRO, ELO, and ELO\\_DEBIT.\n\n## Pass Google Pay payment token in request\n\nWhen you initiate a transaction with Google Pay, a payment token containing encrypted payment data is returned. Pass the complete token received from Google Pay in the `payment_method.detail.wallet.payment_token` field as a JSON string in your payment request.\n\n### Google Pay wallet response object\n\nThe Google Pay SDK returns the following object structure, which must be passed as the complete `payment_token` value:\n\nJSON\n\n```\n{\n  \"apiVersion\": 2,\n  \"apiVersionMinor\": 0,\n  \"paymentMethodData\": {\n    \"type\": \"CARD\",\n    \"description\": \"Visa •••• 1234\",\n    \"info\": {\n      \"cardNetwork\": \"VISA\",\n      \"cardDetails\": \"1234\"\n    },\n    \"tokenizationData\": {\n      \"type\": \"PAYMENT_GATEWAY\",\n      \"token\": \"examplePaymentMethodToken\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Request example\n\nJSON\n\n```\n{\n  \"country\": \"US\",\n  \"amount\": {\n    \"currency\": \"USD\",\n    \"value\": 100\n  },\n  \"customer_payer\": {\n    \"merchant_customer_validations\": {\n      \"account_is_verified\": true,\n      \"email_is_verified\": true,\n      \"phone_is_verified\": true\n    }\n  },\n  \"workflow\": \"DIRECT\",\n  \"payment_method\": {\n    \"detail\": {\n      \"wallet\": {\n        \"payment_token\": \"{\\\"apiVersion\\\":2,\\\"apiVersionMinor\\\":0,\\\"paymentMethodData\\\":{\\\"type\\\":\\\"CARD\\\",\\\"description\\\":\\\"Visa •••• 1234\\\",\\\"info\\\":{\\\"cardNetwork\\\":\\\"VISA\\\",\\\"cardDetails\\\":\\\"1234\\\"},\\\"tokenizationData\\\":{\\\"type\\\":\\\"PAYMENT_GATEWAY\\\",\\\"token\\\":\\\"examplePaymentMethodToken\\\"}}}\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"type\": \"GOOGLE_PAY\"\n  },\n  \"account_id\": \"1d67e224-9a01-4ffc-a465-7db5c2ced44d\",\n  \"description\": \"Google Pay test\",\n  \"merchant_order_id\": \"MER01\"\n}\n```\n\nUpdated 24 days ago\n\n---\n\n[Google Pay™](/docs/google-pay)[Integration Via Provider](/docs/integration-via-provider-google-pay)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Requirements](#requirements)\n  + [Integration](#integration)\n  + [Enable and test Google Pay with Yuno](#enable-and-test-google-pay-with-yuno)\n  + [Go live](#go-live)\n  + [Implementation details](#implementation-details)\n  + - [Google Pay API authorization methods](#google-pay-api-authorization-methods)\n  + [Additional information](#additional-information)\n  + - [Card networks supported](#card-networks-supported)\n  + [Pass Google Pay payment token in request](#pass-google-pay-payment-token-in-request)\n  + - [Google Pay wallet response object](#google-pay-wallet-response-object)\n    - [Request example](#request-example)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/2fee3d1-google-pay1.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/2fee3d1-google-pay1.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "google pay pay screen"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/fbc51b7-6847ef9-demo_mode.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/fbc51b7-6847ef9-demo_mode.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "google wallet with google account"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/lite-checkout-ios", "title": "Lite SDK (Payment iOS)", "content_markdown": "# Lite SDK (Payment iOS)\n\n> 👍\n>\n> ### Recommended SDK\n>\n> We recommend using the [iOS Seamless SDK](seamless-sdk-payment-ios) for a smooth integration experience. This option provides a flexible payment solution with pre-built UI components and customization options.\n\nThis guide walks you through integrating Yuno's Lite iOS SDK for payments into your project.\n\n## Requirements\n\nBefore implementing the Yuno iOS SDK, ensure you meet these requirements:\n\n* Add [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html) or [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/) to your project.\n* Use iOS version 14.0 or above.\n\n## Step 1: Include the library in your project\n\nYou can add the library using CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager.\n\n### CocoaPods\n\nAdd the Yuno SDK to your iOS project using CocoaPods. If you don't have a Podfile, follow the [CocoaPods guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html) to create one. Then add the following line to your Podfile:\n\nRuby\n\n```\npod 'YunoSDK', '~> 1.1.22'\n```\n\nThen run the installation:\n\nRuby\n\n```\npod install\n```\n\n### Swift Package Manager\n\nAdd the Yuno SDK using Swift Package Manager. Add `YunoSDK` as a dependency in your Package.swift file:\n\nSwift\n\n```\ndependencies: [\n    .package(url: \"https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-ios.git\", .upToNextMajor(from: \"1.1.17\"))\n]\n```\n\n## Step 2: Initialize SDK with the public key\n\nInitialize the Yuno iOS SDK with your Public API Key:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nimport YunoSDK\n\nYuno.initialize(\n    apiKey: \"PUBLIC_API_KEY\",\n    config: YunoConfig(),\n    callback: { (value: Bool) in }\n)\n```\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### UISceneDelegate\n>\n> If your app is using a UISceneDelegate, you will need to put your Yuno initialization code into your SceneDelegate.\n\nConfigure the SDK appearance and behavior using the `YunoConfig` class. This is optional and allows you to customize the checkout experience:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nfinal class YunoConfig {\n    let cardFormType: CardFormType,\n    let appearance: Yuno.Appearance,\n    let saveCardEnabled: Bool,\n    let keepLoader: Bool\n}\n```\n\nConfigure the SDK with the following options:\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `cardFormType` | This field can be used to choose Payment and Enrollment Card flow. It's an optional property and considers `.oneStep` by default. |\n| `appearance` | This optional field defines the appearance of the checkout. By default, it uses Yuno styles. |\n| `saveCardEnabled` | This optional field can be used to choose if the **Save Card** checkbox is shown on card flows. It is false by default. |\n| `keepLoader` | This optional field provides control over when to hide the loader. If set to `true`, the `hideLoader()` function must be called to hide the loader. By default, it is set to `false`. |\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Accessing Your API Key\n>\n> You can retrieve your API Key from the [Developers section](../docs/developers-credentials) in the Yuno Dashboard.\n\n## Step 3: Start the checkout process\n\nCreate a ViewController that adopts the `YunoPaymentDelegate` protocol:\n\n> ❗️\n>\n> ### Deprecation\n>\n> The `startCheckout` method has been deprecated in recent iOS SDK versions.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nprotocol YunoPaymentDelegate: AnyObject {\n    var checkoutSession: String { get }\n    var countryCode: String { get }\n    var language: String? { get }\n    var viewController: UIViewController? { get }\n\n    func yunoCreatePayment(with token: String)\n    func yunoCreatePayment(with token: String, information: [String: Any])\n    func yunoPaymentResult(_ result: Yuno.Result)\n}\n\n\nclass ViewController: YunoPaymentDelegate {\n\n    func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n    }\n}\n```\n\nParameters\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `checkoutSession` | Refers to the current payment's checkout session. |\n| `countryCode` | This parameter determines the country for which the payment process is being configured. The complete list of supported countries and their country code is available on the [Country coverage](/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk) page. |\n| `language` | Defines the language to be used in the payment forms. You can set it to one of the available language options:  * es (Spanish) * en (English) * pt (Portuguese) * fil (Filipino) * id (Indonesian) * ms (Malay) * th (Thai) * zh-TW (Chinese (Traditional, Taiwan)) * zh-CN (Chinese (Simplified, China)) * vi (Vietnamese) * fr (French) * pl (Polish) * it (Italian) * de (German) * ru (Russian) * tr (Turkish) * nl (Dutch) * sv (Swedish) * ko (Korean) * ja (Japanese) |\n| `viewController` | This property represents the `UIViewController` used to present the payment flow. Even though the property remains optional for backward compatibility, you must supply a visible controller so the SDK can present its UI correctly. |\n| `yunoCreatePayment(with token: String)` | This method is responsible for creating a payment with the provided token. It takes a String parameter called `token`, which represents the payment token. |\n| `yunoCreatePayment(with token: String, information: [String: Any])` | This method is responsible for creating a payment with the provided token. It takes a String parameter called `token`, representing the payment token. Additionally, it returns all the token response info in a dictionary. |\n| `yunoPaymentResult(_ result: Yuno.Result)` | This method is called when the payment process is completed, providing the result of the payment as a parameter of type `Yuno.Result`. |\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Important Note\n>\n> You can call `yunoCreatePayment` with or without the `information` parameter based on your needs. However, use only one version in your code, as calling both is not required and may cause issues.\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Swift 6 Concurrency Requirements\n>\n> If you're using Swift 6, you'll need to implement the `YunoPaymentDelegate` protocol with specific concurrency considerations. Swift 6 introduces stricter thread safety requirements that affect how you implement delegates. See the [Implementing `YunoPaymentDelegate` with Swift 6 Concurrency](#implementing-yunopaymentdelegate-with-swift-6-concurrency) section for detailed implementation options and best practices.\n\n## Step 4: Initiate the payment process\n\nTo effectively start a payment after displaying the payment methods, you have to call the method `startPaymentLite`, as presented in the code snippet below:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nstartPaymentLite(\n    with: YunoPaymentDelegate,\n    paymentSelected: PaymentMethodSelected,\n    showPaymentStatus: Bool\n)\n```\n\nFor the Lite checkout version, you need to send an additional parameter, which can be the vaulted token and/or the payment method the customer will use to make the payment.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nprotocol PaymentMethodSelected {\n    var vaultedToken: String? { get }\n    var paymentMethodType: String { get }\n}\n\nstartPaymentLite(with: self, paymentSelected: paymentSelected)\n```\n\n## Step 5: Get the OTT (one-time token)\n\nYou can obtain the one-time token to create the payment back-to-back at the end of this process. You will get the one-time token in the function `yunoCreatePayment()` that you get when implementing the `YunoPaymentDelegate`. An example of retrieving the one-time token is presented below:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nfunc yunoCreatePayment(with token: String) { ... }\n```\n\n## Step 6: Create the Payment\n\nOnce you have completed the steps described before, you can create a payment. The back-to-back payment creation must be carried out using the [Create Payment endpoint](/reference/create-payment). The merchant should call their backend to create the payment within Yuno, using the one-time token and the checkout session.\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Continue Method\n>\n> Yuno **requires** you integrate the `continuePayment` method of the SDK after the payment is created because certain asynchronous payment methods require additional action from the customer to complete it. The API will inform you of this scenario via the `sdk_action_required` field of the response, which will be returned as true. The `yuno.continuePayment()` function will display the additional screens to the customers, where they can carry out the necessary actions to complete the payment without needing you to handle every scenario.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nYuno.continuePayment()\n```\n\n## Step 7: Handle Payment Status (Optional)\n\n> ❗️\n>\n> ### Deep Links and Mercado Pago Checkout Pro\n>\n> This step is only required if you're using a payment method that relies on deep links or Mercado Pago Checkout Pro. If your payment methods don't use deep links, you can skip this step.\n\nSome payment methods take users out of your app to complete the transaction. Once the payment is finished, the user is redirected back to your app using a deep link. The SDK uses this deep link to check what happened, checking if the payment was successful, failed, or canceled, and can show a status screen to the user.\n\nTo handle this, you need to update your `AppDelegate` to pass the incoming URL back to the Yuno SDK. This lets the SDK read the result and optionally display the payment status. The following code snippet shows how you can add it to your app:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nfunc application(_ app: UIApplication,\n                 open url: URL,\n                 options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {\n\n  guard url.scheme == \"yunoexample\" else { return false }\n\n  return Yuno.receiveDeeplink(url)\n}\n```\n\nThis code listens for deep links that open your app. When a URL is received, it checks if the scheme matches the one you used in the `callback_url` during checkout session setup. If it matches, the URL is passed to the Yuno SDK using `Yuno.receiveDeeplink(...)`. The SDK then reads the payment result and shows the appropriate status screen to the user.\n\nMake sure the `url.scheme` in this code matches the `callback_url` you provided when creating the `checkout_session`.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Click to Pay\n>\n> For Click to Pay support, follow the dedicated [Click to Pay SDK integration](/docs/click-to-pay#sdk-integration) guide in the Wallets section.\n\n## Callback\n\nThe SDK returns different transaction states after payment completion. The following table describes each state:\n\n| Transaction state | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `success` | Indicates that the transaction or payment process has been completed successfully. |\n| `fail` | This state indicates that the transaction or payment process has failed. It means that there was an error or issue during the payment process, preventing it from being completed successfully. |\n| `processing` | Indicates that the transaction or payment process is currently being processed. It is typically used when there is a delay in processing the payment, such as waiting for approval from a third-party service or financial institution. |\n| `reject` | This state indicates that the transaction has been rejected. The rejection can occur for various reasons, such as insufficient funds, fraudulent activity, or a request that violates specific rules or policies. |\n| `internalError` | It means that an unexpected error occurred within the system or infrastructure handling the payment process. This state suggests that there was a problem on the server or backend side rather than an issue with the user's input or request. |\n| `userCancell` | This state indicates that the user has voluntarily canceled or aborted the transaction or payment process. This state is typically used when there is an option for the user to cancel or abandon the payment process. |\n\nImplement the delegate to receive transaction states:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nenum Result {\n    case reject, success, fail, processing, internalError, userCancell\n}\n\nfunc yunoPaymentResult(_ result: Yuno.Result) { ... }\nfunc yunoEnrollmentResult(_ result: Yuno.Result) { ... }\n```\n\n## Complementary Features\n\nThe Yuno iOS SDK provides additional features to enhance the customer experience. Use [SDK Customizations](../docs/sdk-customizations-ios) to match your brand appearance or configure the loader.\n\n* **Loader**: Control the use of the loader through the SDK configuration options.\n* **Save card for future payments**: In addition, you can display a checkbox for save or enroll cards using `cardSaveEnable: true`. Below, you can find examples of the checkbox for both card form renders.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/89c94f120736a724c6b46a05f82ee8b95d3e892046d11a119635f5ab0d1d59a4-Card___save_for_future_payments.png)\n\n* You also can choose one of the render options for the card form. Below, you find screenshots presenting the difference between the `cardFormType` `ONE_STEP` and `STEP_BY_STEP`.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/602fa6e31d55d6e71826ec7b429fc6842e06b3cccbf2d00339e485f97d97a841-Full_SDK_ios.png)\n\n* [SDK Customizations](../docs/sdk-customizations-ios): Change the SDK appearance to match your brand.\n\n## Render mode integration\n\nThe render mode in the Yuno SDK offers enhanced UI flexibility, enabling developers to integrate payment flows with complete control over the user interface while retaining full SDK functionality. This mode provides SwiftUI views that can be seamlessly incorporated into your existing UI.\n\n### Main function: `startPaymentRenderFlow`\n\nThe `startPaymentRender` function is a feature of the Yuno SDK that allows merchants to integrate the payment process in a more detailed and customizable manner. This function grants full control over when and how payment forms are displayed, facilitating smoother integration with the merchant's existing application UI.\n\n#### Purpose\n\nThis function is designed to offer greater control over the payment flow, allowing merchants to:\n\n* Integrate payment forms in a customized manner within their own UI.\n* Precisely control when payment data forms are displayed.\n* Gain detailed control over the payment confirmation process.\n* Provide a more fluid and consistent user experience within the merchant's application.\n\n#### Syntax\n\nThe syntax section provides the method signature for the `startPaymentRender` function. This function is central to integrating the payment process within your application, offering a customizable and detailed approach to handling payment forms and flows.\n\nSwift\n\n```\n@MainActor static func startPaymentRenderFlow(\n    paymentMethodSelected: PaymentMethodSelected,\n    with delegate: YunoPaymentDelegate\n) async -> some YunoPaymentRenderFlowProtocol\n```\n\nParameters\n\nThe `startPaymentRender` function requires specific parameters to operate effectively. These parameters are essential for defining the payment method and handling the payment process responses.\n\n| Parameter | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `paymentMethodSelected` | `PaymentMethodSelected` | The payment method selected by the user. Must include the `vaultedToken` (if exists) and the `paymentMethodType` |\n| `delegate` | `YunoPaymentDelegate` | The delegate that will handle payment process responses, including token creation and final result |\n\n#### Return value\n\nReturns an instance that conforms to `YunoPaymentRenderFlowProtocol`, which provides methods to handle the payment rendering flow.\n\n### YunoPaymentRenderFlowProtocol protocol\n\nThe instance returned by `startPaymentRender` conforms to this protocol which includes the following methods:\n\n#### formView(paymentMethodSelected:with:)\n\nSwift\n\n```\nfunc formView(\n    paymentMethodSelected: PaymentMethodSelected,\n    with delegate: YunoPaymentDelegate\n) async -> AnyView?\n```\n\n* **Purpose**: Gets the form view to capture payment data\n* **Behavior**:\n  + If the payment method requires showing a form, returns an `AnyView` with the corresponding form\n  + If the payment method doesn't need to show any form (e.g., already configured methods), returns `nil`\n* **When to use**: Call immediately after creating the payment flow instance\n\n#### submitForm()\n\nSwift\n\n```\nfunc submitForm()\n```\n\n* **Purpose**: Submits form data for validation\n* **Behavior**: Executes all necessary validations and, if successful, proceeds to generate a new one-time token\n* **When to use**: When the user executes the \"pay\" action in the merchant's application\n\n#### continuePayment()\n\nSwift\n\n```\nfunc continuePayment() async -> AnyView?\n```\n\n* **Purpose**: Continues the payment process after the one-time token has been generated\n* **Behavior**:\n  i. If it's necessary to show any additional view (e.g., 3DS authentication), returns an `AnyView`\n  ii. If no additional view is required, returns `nil`\n* **When to use**: After receiving the one-time token through the delegate and creating the payment\n\n### Implementation flow\n\nThis section outlines the sequence of steps required to implement the payment rendering process using the Yuno SDK.\n\n#### Step 1: Initial setup\n\nTo begin using `startPaymentRender`, make sure the SDK is properly initialized and you possess a valid `checkoutSession`. Follow the steps below to set up your environment:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nawait Yuno.initialize(apiKey: \"your_api_key\")\n```\n\n#### Step 2: Create payment flow instance\n\nCreate a payment flow instance to manage and render the payment process using the selected method.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nlet paymentFlow = await Yuno.startPaymentRenderFlow(\n    paymentMethodSelected: selectedPaymentMethod,\n    with: self\n)\n```\n\n#### Step 3: Get and display the form\n\nRetrieve and present the payment form to collect user payment information efficiently.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nlet formView = await paymentFlow.formView(\n    paymentMethodSelected: selectedPaymentMethod,\n    with: self\n)\n\nif let formView = formView {\n    VStack {\n        Text(\"Payment Information\")\n\n        formView\n\n        Button(\"Pay\") {\n            paymentFlow.submitForm()\n        }\n    }\n} else {\n    paymentFlow.submitForm()\n}\n```\n\n#### Step 4: Handle the one time token\n\nImplement the delegate method to receive the token:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nextension MyViewController: YunoPaymentDelegate {\n    var checkoutSession: String {\n        return \"your_checkout_session\"\n    }\n\n    var countryCode: String {\n        return \"CO\"\n    }\n\n    var viewController: UIViewController? {\n        return self\n    }\n\n    func yunoCreatePayment(with token: String, information: [String: Any]) {\n        createPaymentInBackend(token: token) { [weak self] success in\n            if success {\n                Task {\n                    let additionalView = await self?.paymentFlow?.continuePayment()\n                    if let additionalView = additionalView {\n                        self?.showAdditionalView(additionalView)\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    func yunoPaymentResult(_ result: Yuno.Result) {\n        switch result {\n        case .succeeded:\n            showSuccessMessage()\n        case .reject:\n            showRejectionMessage()\n        case .fail:\n            showErrorMessage()\n        case .processing:\n            showProcessingMessage()\n        case .userCancell:\n            handleCancellation()\n        case .internalError:\n            showInternalErrorMessage()\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Complete example\n\nSwift\n\n```\nimport SwiftUI\nimport YunoSDK\n\nstruct PaymentRenderView: View {\n    @State private var paymentFlow: YunoPaymentRenderFlowProtocol?\n    @State private var formView: AnyView?\n    @State private var additionalView: AnyView?\n\n    let selectedPaymentMethod: PaymentMethodSelected\n    let delegate: YunoPaymentDelegate\n\n    var body: some View {\n        VStack(spacing: 20) {\n            Text(\"Complete Purchase\")\n                .font(.title2)\n                .fontWeight(.bold)\n\n            OrderSummaryView()\n\n            if let formView = formView {\n                VStack(alignment: .leading) {\n                    Text(\"Payment Information\")\n                        .font(.headline)\n\n                    formView\n                }\n            }\n\n            if let additionalView = additionalView {\n                additionalView\n            }\n\n            Spacer()\n\n            Button(action: {\n                paymentFlow?.submitForm()\n            }) {\n                Text(\"Confirm Payment\")\n                    .font(.headline)\n                    .foregroundColor(.white)\n                    .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)\n                    .padding()\n                    .background(Color.blue)\n                    .cornerRadius(10)\n            }\n        }\n        .padding()\n        .onAppear {\n            setupPaymentFlow()\n        }\n    }\n\n    private func setupPaymentFlow() {\npaymentFlow = await Yuno.startPaymentRenderFlow(\n    paymentMethodSelected: selectedPaymentMethod,\n    with: delegate\n)\n\n        Task {\n            formView = await paymentFlow?.formView(\n                paymentMethodSelected: selectedPaymentMethod,\n                with: delegate\n            )\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nclass PaymentDelegate: YunoPaymentDelegate {\n    let checkoutSession: String\n    let countryCode: String\n    weak var viewController: UIViewController?\n\n    init(checkoutSession: String, countryCode: String, viewController: UIViewController?) {\n        self.checkoutSession = checkoutSession\n        self.countryCode = countryCode\n        self.viewController = viewController\n    }\n\n    func yunoCreatePayment(with token: String, information: [String: Any]) {\n        PaymentService.createPayment(token: token) { [weak self] result in\n            switch result {\n            case .success:\n                Task {\n                    await self?.continuePaymentProcess()\n                }\n            case .failure(let error):\n                print(\"Error creating payment: \\(error)\")\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    func yunoPaymentResult(_ result: Yuno.Result) {\n        DispatchQueue.main.async {\n            switch result {\n            case .succeeded:\n                NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .paymentSucceeded, object: nil)\n            case .reject:\n                NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .paymentRejected, object: nil)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    private func continuePaymentProcess() async {\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Common use cases\n\nThis section outlines typical scenarios where the Yuno SDK can be utilized to handle various payment methods, providing flexibility and ease of integration.\n\n#### 1. Credit card payment\n\nIn this use case, we demonstrate how to process payments using new credit card information, requiring the user to fill out a form to capture the necessary card details.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nlet cardPayment = CardPaymentMethod(paymentMethodType: \"CARD\")\nlet flow = Yuno.startPaymentRender(paymentMethodSelected: cardPayment, with: delegate)\n\nlet form = await flow.formView(paymentMethodSelected: cardPayment, with: delegate)\n```\n\n#### 2. Payment with saved method\n\nThis scenario demonstrates using a saved payment method, allowing users to pay without re-entering details by utilizing a vaulted token.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nlet savedCard = SavedCardPayment(\n    paymentMethodType: \"CARD\",\n    vaultedToken: \"saved_token_123\"\n)\nlet flow = Yuno.startPaymentRender(paymentMethodSelected: savedCard, with: delegate)\n\nlet form = await flow.formView(paymentMethodSelected: savedCard, with: delegate)\n```\n\n#### 3. Payment with 3DS authentication\n\n3D Secure (3DS) adds an extra verification step for enhanced security. The Yuno SDK integrates this process into your payment flow seamlessly.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nfunc yunoCreatePayment(with token: String, information: [String: Any]) {\n    createPayment(token: token) { [weak self] success in\n        if success {\n            Task {\n                let authView = await self?.paymentFlow?.continuePayment()\n                if let authView = authView {\n                    self?.show3DSView(authView)\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Important considerations\n\nThis section highlights key points for integrating the Yuno SDK effectively, ensuring a seamless and secure payment process.\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\n* Ensure the SDK is initialized before using `startPaymentRender`\n* The delegate must implement all required methods of `YunoPaymentDelegate`\n* The `checkoutSession` must be valid and active\n\n#### State management\n\n* Always check if `formView()` returns `nil` before displaying the view\n* Properly handle the case where `continuePayment()` returns `nil`\n* Implement loading states during asynchronous operations\n\n#### Security\n\n* Never store one-time tokens - use them immediately\n* Always validate payment results in your backend\n* Implement appropriate timeouts for network operations\n\n#### Performance\n\n* Calls to `formView()` and `continuePayment()` are asynchronous\n* Consider showing loading indicators during these operations\n* Reuse the payment flow instance when possible\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nThis section offers quick solutions to common issues encountered during Yuno SDK integration, ensuring a smoother payment process.\n\n#### Common issues\n\n1. **`formView()`always returns`nil`**\n\n   * Verify that the selected payment method requires a form\n   * Ensure the SDK is initialized correctly\n2. **Delegate doesn't receive`yunoCreatePayment`**\n\n   * Verify that `submitForm()` is being called correctly\n   * Confirm that the form has valid data\n3. **`continuePayment()`doesn't return view when expected**\n\n   * Some payment methods don't require additional views\n   * Check the payment method configuration in your Yuno dashboard\n\n#### Debugging logs\n\nSwift\n\n```\nYuno.config.environment = .staging\n```\n\n### Migration from other methods\n\nIf you're migrating from `startPayment()` or `startPaymentLite()`:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nYuno.startPayment()\n\nlet flow = Yuno.startPaymentRender(paymentMethodSelected: method, with: delegate)\nlet form = await flow.formView(paymentMethodSelected: method, with: delegate)\n```\n\nThe primary benefit of using the new method is the detailed control it provides over both the user interface and the payment process.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Demo app\n>\n> In addition to the code examples provided, you can access the [Yuno repository](https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-ios) for a complete implementation of Yuno iOS SDKs.\n\n## Implementing `YunoPaymentDelegate` with Swift 6 Concurrency\n\nSwift 6 introduces stricter concurrency requirements that affect how you implement the `YunoPaymentDelegate` protocol. This section explains the challenges and provides solutions for different implementation scenarios.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Understanding Concurrency in Swift 6\n>\n> Concurrency is the ability of your app to manage multiple tasks simultaneously. With Swift 6, concurrency rules have become more stringent to enhance app stability and prevent crashes. This means that your code must be more carefully structured to ensure thread safety and proper task management.\n\n### The problem\n\nWith Swift 6, protocols that inherit from `Sendable` require all their implementations to be thread-safe. This generates warnings when implementing the delegate in classes marked as `@MainActor`.\n\nThread-safe means your code can be safely called from multiple threads without causing crashes or unexpected behavior. `@MainActor` ensures code runs on the main thread (UI thread).\n\n### Our design decision\n\nWe do not mark protocols as `@MainActor` because:\n\n* It would force all implementations to be `MainActor`-compatible\n* It would reduce flexibility for merchants who don't use `MainActor`\n* Each implementation has different concurrency needs\n\n### Merchant's responsibility\n\nIt's the merchant's responsibility to handle concurrency according to their implementation. Below are three different approaches you can use depending on your specific needs.\n\n#### Option 1: Immutable properties\n\nThis approach uses immutable properties that are automatically thread-safe, making them ideal for simple configurations. It is best suited for simple apps with fixed configuration values that don't change during runtime.\n\nSwift\n\n```\n@MainActor\nclass MyViewController: UIViewController, YunoPaymentDelegate {\n\n    private let _countryCode = \"CO\"\n    private let _language = \"EN\"\n\n    nonisolated var countryCode: String { _countryCode }\n    nonisolated var language: String? { _language }\n    nonisolated var checkoutSession: String { _checkoutSession }\n\n    nonisolated func yunoPaymentResult(_ result: Yuno.Result) {\n        Task { @MainActor in\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Option 2: Mutable properties with `MainActor.assumeIsolated`\n\nThis approach, best for apps where configuration values might change during runtime (like user preferences), allows for mutable properties while maintaining thread safety by using `MainActor.assumeIsolated`.\n\nSwift\n\n```\n@MainActor\nclass MyViewController: UIViewController, YunoPaymentDelegate {\n\n    @Published var configLanguage: String = \"EN\"\n    @Published var configCountryCode: String = \"CO\"\n\n    nonisolated var language: String? {\n        MainActor.assumeIsolated { configLanguage }\n    }\n\n    nonisolated var countryCode: String {\n        MainActor.assumeIsolated { configCountryCode }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n#### Option 3: For non-`MainActor` classes\n\nThis approach is suitable for service classes that don't require `MainActor` isolation, making it best for background services or utility classes that don't interact with the UI.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nclass MyService: YunoPaymentDelegate {\n\n    let countryCode: String\n    let language: String?\n    let checkoutSession: String\n    let viewController: UIViewController?\n\n    init(countryCode: String, language: String?, checkoutSession: String, viewController: UIViewController?) {\n        self.countryCode = countryCode\n        self.language = language\n        self.checkoutSession = checkoutSession\n        self.viewController = viewController\n    }\n\n    func yunoPaymentResult(_ result: Yuno.Result) {\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### ⚠️ Important considerations\n\nWhen implementing concurrency in your delegate, keep these key points in mind:\n\n* `MainActor.assumeIsolated`: Only use when you guarantee it's called from `MainActor`. This is a safety mechanism that tells Swift \"trust me, I know this is running on the main thread.\"\n* `nonisolated`: Means it can be accessed from any thread, so it must be thread-safe. Use this when your properties or methods don't depend on UI state.\n* `viewController`: Remains as `@MainActor` because it should always be accessed from the main thread. UI components must always run on the main thread to prevent crashes.\n\nUpdated 12 days ago\n\n---\n\n[Full SDK (iOS)](/docs/full-checkout-ios)[Lite SDK (Enrollment iOS)](/docs/enrollment-ios)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Requirements](#requirements)\n  + [Step 1: Include the library in your project](#step-1-include-the-library-in-your-project)\n  + - [CocoaPods](#cocoapods)\n    - [Swift Package Manager](#swift-package-manager)\n  + [Step 2: Initialize SDK with the public key](#step-2-initialize-sdk-with-the-public-key)\n  + [Step 3: Start the checkout process](#step-3-start-the-checkout-process)\n  + [Step 4: Initiate the payment process](#step-4-initiate-the-payment-process)\n  + [Step 5: Get the OTT (one-time token)](#step-5-get-the-ott-one-time-token)\n  + [Step 6: Create the Payment](#step-6-create-the-payment)\n  + [Step 7: Handle Payment Status (Optional)](#step-7-handle-payment-status-optional)\n  + [Callback](#callback)\n  + [Complementary Features](#complementary-features)\n  + [Render mode integration](#render-mode-integration)\n  + - [Main function: startPaymentRenderFlow](#main-function-startpaymentrenderflow)\n    - [YunoPaymentRenderFlowProtocol protocol](#yunopaymentrenderflowprotocol-protocol)\n    - [Implementation flow](#implementation-flow)\n    - [Complete example](#complete-example)\n    - [Common use cases](#common-use-cases)\n    - [Important considerations](#important-considerations)\n    - [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\n    - [Migration from other methods](#migration-from-other-methods)\n  + [Implementing YunoPaymentDelegate with Swift 6 Concurrency](#implementing-yunopaymentdelegate-with-swift-6-concurrency)\n  + - [The problem](#the-problem)\n    - [Our design decision](#our-design-decision)\n    - [Merchant's responsibility](#merchants-responsibility)\n    - [⚠️ Important considerations](#%EF%B8%8F-important-considerations)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/89c94f120736a724c6b46a05f82ee8b95d3e892046d11a119635f5ab0d1d59a4-Card___save_for_future_payments.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/89c94f120736a724c6b46a05f82ee8b95d3e892046d11a119635f5ab0d1d59a4-Card___save_for_future_payments.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the payment screen with the payment button highlighted"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/602fa6e31d55d6e71826ec7b429fc6842e06b3cccbf2d00339e485f97d97a841-Full_SDK_ios.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/602fa6e31d55d6e71826ec7b429fc6842e06b3cccbf2d00339e485f97d97a841-Full_SDK_ios.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a phone with a credit card on the screen"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

It determines the mode in which the payment forms will be displayed. |\n|  | * `type`: can be one of `modal` or `element`. |\n|  | * `elementSelector`: Element where the form will be rendered. Only required if `type` is `element`. |\n| `elementSelector` | Required only if the type is `element`. Specifies the HTML elements where you want to mount the Yuno SDK. You can specify the elements using one of the following options: |\n|  | * **String (Deprecated)**: Provide the ID or selector of the element where the SDK should be mounted. |\n|  | * **Object**: Specify the elements for mounting the APM and action forms. You need to provide the element for the `apmForm`, which is where the APM is displayed, and the element for the `actionForm`, where the Continue Payment button appears. |\n|  | This button triggers a modal that shows the steps to complete a payment with a provider. For example, with PIX, it displays a QR code. |\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyuno.startCheckout({\n  renderMode: {\n    type: 'modal',\n    elementSelector: {\n      apmForm: \"#form-element\",\n      actionForm: \"#action-form-element\"\n    } \n  },\n})\n```\n\n  \n\n## Card form configurations\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `card` | Define specific settings for the credit card form: |\n|  | * `type`: `step` or `extends` |\n|  | * `styles`: You can edit card form styles.

Below are examples of the checkbox for both card form renders.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/37b2e00b0c6a3d31bceb42b26b1b433c8d30e61d947a93298dd90c466bde004b-complementary-features.png)\n\n### Rendering modes\n\nBelow you find screenshots presenting the difference between the following:\n\n* Render modes `modal` and `elements` for the payment method list.\n* Render modes `step` and `extends` for the credit card form.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/b56fe6dfdebaee158495dea86d5269d865fae2dfcb81eb8b34879f9e5e737f0e-caracteristicas_Complemetarias_web_1.png)\n\nYou also can choose one of the render options for the card form, `step` and `extends`:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/08654f8fa7b638641cb1b9f5b882a75537a9e449fff4960cf560c1ec5b3efb74-caracteristicas_Complemetarias_web_2.png)\n\n### Text payment form buttons\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `texts` | Provide custom text for payment form buttons to match your application's language or branding. |\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyuno.startCheckout({\n  texts: {\n    customerForm?: {\n      submitButton?: string;\n    }\n    paymentOtp?: {\n      sendOtpButton?: string;\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\n### Persist credit card form to retry payments\n\nIf a transaction is rejected, you can use the credit card form to retry a payment after the customer has entered the credit card details. To do that, you will need to:\n\n1. Add the following parameter while initializing the SDK to persist the credit card form after the one-time use token is created:\n\n   JavaScript\n\n   ```\n   yuno.startCheckout({\n     automaticallyUnmount: false,\n   })\n   ```\n2. In case the transaction is rejected, you will need to:\n   1. Execute the method `yuno.notifyError()` to delete the previously entered CVV for the first transaction.\n   2. Create a new checkout session and update the SDK with the new one by executing `yuno.updateCheckoutSession(checkoutsession)`\n3. Continue with the new checkout and one-time use token with the regular payment flow.\n\n### Hide Pay button\n\nYou can hide the Pay button when presenting the card or customer data form. To control this feature, you'll set `showPayButton` to `false` when starting the checkout with the `startCheckout` function. The code block below presents an example of how to hide the payment button:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyuno.startCheckout({\n  showPayButton: false,\n})\n```\n\nThe following images present examples of the Customer Data Form with and without the Pay button:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/873a709f1c3dce3c3dcc13dd4fd3cc9b5a8ecdf812c3b631f3cf8700177cc5cf-Card_boton.png)\n\nThe following images present examples of the Card Form with and without the Pay button:\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/b8b5e51ab3f5907786b802cb782a71e043f4ec18475b6e5b6d4dd052c6dc4e37-Card_boton_1.png)\n\nIf you hide the Pay button, you will need to start the OTT creation through your code. To create the OTT and continue the payment in your backend, call the `submitOneTimeTokenForm` function. The code block below presents how to use the `submitOneTimeTokenForm` function.\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nyuno.submitOneTimeTokenForm()\n```\n\n## Mercado Pago Checkout Pro webview handling\n\n> ❗️\n>\n> ### Special Exception\n>\n> This section describes a special exception for handling Mercado Pago Checkout Pro integration in webview environments. This is the only payment method that requires custom redirect handling, and it is documented here to avoid overwhelming merchants with unnecessary implementation details for other payment methods.\n\nFor Mercado Pago Checkout Pro integration in webview environments, the `await yuno.continuePayment()` method will return either an object with redirect information or null. When the method returns an object, it allows you to handle the custom redirect flow required by Mercado Pago Checkout Pro. When it returns null, no additional merchant-side action is needed.\n\nTypeScript\n\n```\n{\n  action: 'REDIRECT_URL'\n  type: 'MERCADO_PAGO_CHECKOUT_PRO'  // Enum value identifying Mercado Pago Checkout Pro\n  redirect: {\n    init_url: string    // URL to redirect to for completing the payment\n    success_url: string // URL to redirect to after successful payment\n    error_url: string   // URL to redirect to after failed payment\n  }\n} | null\n```\n\n### Properties\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `action` | * Always set to `'REDIRECT_URL'` when redirect handling is required. |\n| `type` | * Enum value `'MERCADO_PAGO_CHECKOUT_PRO'` identifying Mercado Pago Checkout Pro as the payment method requiring custom handling. |\n| `init_url` | * URL to redirect the customer to for completing the payment with Mercado Pago Checkout Pro. |\n| `success_url` | * URL to redirect the customer to after a successful payment with Mercado Pago Checkout Pro. |\n| `error_url` | * URL to redirect the customer to if the payment with Mercado Pago Checkout Pro fails. |\n\n## Optional initialization `options` parameter\n\nStarting from **Yuno SDK v1.2**, the `Yuno.initialize` function supports a new optional parameter called `options`. This allows for advanced configuration such as customizing the cookie name used for device identification.\n\n### Initialization options\n\nThe updated function signature is:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst yuno = await Yuno.initialize(publicApiKey, applicationSession, options);\n```\n\n* `publicApiKey` (`string`): Your public API key.\n* `applicationSession` (`string | undefined`): Optional session ID.\n  > **Recommendation:** Leave this as `undefined` so the SDK can generate and manage its own session internally. Only set this if you require a custom session management strategy.\n* `options` (`object | undefined`): Optional object for advanced configuration.\n\n### Options structure\n\nThe `options` object supports the following shape:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst options = {\n  cookies: {\n    deviceId: {\n      name: \"customCookieName\" // Overrides the default cookie name used for device ID\n    }\n  }\n};\n```\n\n> **Note:** If `deviceId.name` is not specified, the SDK defaults to `\"yuno\"` as the cookie name.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nconst publicApiKey = 'your-public-api-key';\nconst options = {\n  cookies: {\n    deviceId: {\n      name: 'custom-device-id'\n    }\n  }\n};\n\n// Recommended: omit the second parameter or set it to undefined\nconst yuno = await Yuno.initialize(publicApiKey, undefined, options);\n```\n\nThis feature is **optional** and is intended for **advanced use cases** where you need to customize how device identification is handled via cookies.\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago\n\n---\n\n[SDK Customizations](/docs/sdk-customizations-ios)[Country coverage](/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Form loader](#form-loader)\n  + [Form of the issuer](#form-of-the-issuer)\n  + [Mode of form rendering](#mode-of-form-rendering)\n  + [Card form configurations](#card-form-configurations)\n  + - [Save card for future payments](#save-card-for-future-payments)\n    - [Rendering modes](#rendering-modes)\n    - [Text payment form buttons](#text-payment-form-buttons)\n    - [Persist credit card form to retry payments](#persist-credit-card-form-to-retry-payments)\n    - [Hide Pay button](#hide-pay-button)\n  + [Mercado Pago Checkout Pro webview handling](#mercado-pago-checkout-pro-webview-handling)\n  + - [Properties](#properties)\n  + [Optional initialization options parameter](#optional-initialization-options-parameter)\n  + - [Initialization options](#initialization-options)\n    - [Options structure](#options-structure)\n    - [Example Usage](#example-usage)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/37b2e00b0c6a3d31bceb42b26b1b433c8d30e61d947a93298dd90c466bde004b-complementary-features.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/37b2e00b0c6a3d31bceb42b26b1b433c8d30e61d947a93298dd90c466bde004b-complementary-features.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the payment screen with the payment button highlighted"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/b56fe6dfdebaee158495dea86d5269d865fae2dfcb81eb8b34879f9e5e737f0e-caracteristicas_Complemetarias_web_1.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/b56fe6dfdebaee158495dea86d5269d865fae2dfcb81eb8b34879f9e5e737f0e-caracteristicas_Complemetarias_web_1.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the payment screen on the app"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/08654f8fa7b638641cb1b9f5b882a75537a9e449fff4960cf560c1ec5b3efb74-caracteristicas_Complemetarias_web_2.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/08654f8fa7b638641cb1b9f5b882a75537a9e449fff4960cf560c1ec5b3efb74-caracteristicas_Complemetarias_web_2.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a credit card and a credit card on a white background"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/873a709f1c3dce3c3dcc13dd4fd3cc9b5a8ecdf812c3b631f3cf8700177cc5cf-Card_boton.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/873a709f1c3dce3c3dcc13dd4fd3cc9b5a8ecdf812c3b631f3cf8700177cc5cf-Card_boton.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the app interface for the app, showing the user ' s settings"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/b8b5e51ab3f5907786b802cb782a71e043f4ec18475b6e5b6d4dd052c6dc4e37-Card_boton_1.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/b8b5e51ab3f5907786b802cb782a71e043f4ec18475b6e5b6d4dd052c6dc4e37-Card_boton_1.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the user page of the app, showing the user ' s name and the user name"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

Explore the benefits of this feature and understand the difference between \"Merchant\" and \"Provider\" installments for a tailored payment solution.\n\n## Accept card payments in installments\n\nYuno supports payments in installments, which allows you to spread out the cost of a purchase over a longer period of time. This is a great way to make a large purchase more affordable or to free up cash flow for other expenses.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/5e3dd70-image.png)\n\n### Benefits of Using Payments in Installments\n\nThere are several benefits to using installment payments for your customers:\n\n* **Affordability**: Paying in installments can make a large purchase more affordable by spreading out the cost over a longer period of time. This can be especially helpful if the customer doesn't have the full amount of money available upfront.\n* **Flexibility**: With payments in installments, you can offer your customer a payment plan that best suits their need. They can usually choose the number of months to pay off the purchase, as well as the amount of each payment.\n* **Convenience**: Payments in installments can be a convenient way to make a purchase. Customers can usually make payments online or by phone, and they don't have to worry about writing checks or carrying cash.\n\n### Merchant vs. Provider Installments\n\nInstallment implementation varies depending on the origin and your commercial agreements. There are two options merchants can use, one defined by themselves and the other according to the providers' definition:\n\n* **[Merchant](/docs/merchant-installments)**: In this case, the merchant manages its own installment options through individual payment processors, determining the available installment choices for customers within Yuno.\n* **[Provider](/docs/provider-installments)**: When the merchant lacks predefined installment agreements, they rely on the payment processor's installment options. We work with your chosen provider to access the available installments to offer your customers for each transaction.\n\nTo have additional information regarding how to configure each option, you can access the [Merchant Installments](/docs/merchant-installments) or the [Provider Installments](/docs/provider-installments) pages.\n\nUpdated 6 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Enroll Cards with Payment Links](/docs/enroll-cards-with-payment-link)[Merchant Installments](/docs/merchant-installments)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Accept card payments in installments](#accept-card-payments-in-installments)\n  + - [Benefits of Using Payments in Installments](#benefits-of-using-payments-in-installments)\n    - [Merchant vs. Provider Installments](#merchant-vs-provider-installments)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/5e3dd70-image.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/5e3dd70-image.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "a screenshote screen with the payment form"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

You provide instructions once, then Yuno automatically sends transactions on your behalf. See [Subscriptions](/docs/subscriptions).\n\n* Categorization\n* General considerations\n* Create a payment\n* Subscription agreement ID\n* Network transaction ID\n\n## Categorization\n\n| Category | Customer-initiated transactions (CIT) | Merchant-initiated transactions (MIT) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Definition** | Transactions initiated by the customer, such as online and in-store purchases, or ATM withdrawals. | Transactions initiated by the merchant or service provider without the customer's active involvement. |\n| **Examples** | Includes online purchases, in-store purchases, and ATM withdrawals. | Includes recurring payments, automatic subscription renewals, and recurring billing. |\n| **Authentication** | Typically requires cardholder authentication to ensure security. | Requires initial customer authentication to set up, with potential additional authentication based on security regulations and card issuer policies for subsequent transactions. |\n\nDetermining whether a transaction is initiated by the merchant or the customer has significant implications for security, user experience, fraud prevention, and regulatory compliance. This ensures an efficient and secure payment process for all parties involved.\n\n## General considerations\n\n* **Responsibility**: In the context of strong customer authentication (SCA) under PSD2 regulation in the European Union, CIT generally requires higher authentication compared to MIT.\n* **Frequency**: MIT transactions are often recurring and periodic, while CIT are more ad hoc events based on customer actions.\n\n## Create a payment with processing type\n\nTo specify a [payment](/reference/create-payment) with a processing type, use the `stored_credentials` structure inside the `payment_method.detail.card` when creating a payment.\n\n| Parameter | Type | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `reason` | enum | Indicates the reason for storing credentials for the transaction.   `CARD_ON_FILE`   `SUBSCRIPTION`   `UNSCHEDULED_CARD_ON_FILE` |\n| `usage` | enum | A credit card can be stored with or without an initial payment. This field indicates if this is the first time the vaulted\\_token/network\\_token is used or reused.   `FIRST`   `USED` |\n| `subscription_agreement_id` | string | The ID of the agreement with the customer, mandatory for certain markets (e.g., MX). |\n| `network_transaction_id` | string | The ID provided by Visa/Mastercard in the response of the initial payment, which is highly recommended for future use in merchant-initiated transactions (MIT). |\n\n> ❗️\n>\n> ### Critical: Complete All Required Fields\n>\n> * When working with CIT and MIT transactions, it's essential to correctly populate the `usage`, `reason`, and `network_transaction_id` fields. Failing to complete these fields properly can result in **decreased approval rates** and **loss of chargeback disputes**.\n> * Some providers (e.g., Adyen) require that the `reason` field remains consistent across the transaction lifecycle. If your first transaction (`usage=FIRST`) uses `reason=SUBSCRIPTION`, all subsequent transactions (`usage=USED`) must also use `reason=SUBSCRIPTION`.\n\nStore credential reasons\n\n| Reason | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `CARD_ON_FILE` | A customer-initiated payment using a previously enrolled credit card where the cardholder is present. Allows customers one-click payment for a frictionless payment experience. |\n| `SUBSCRIPTION` | Used for merchant-initiated payments as part of a subscription. This does not create a new subscription - use the [Subscription API](/docs/subscriptions) for automated recurring billing. |\n| `UNSCHEDULED_CARD_ON_FILE` | A merchant-initiated payment using stored credit card details that is not related to a subscription schedule or amount. Payment can occur at any given time. |\n\n### Request example\n\nRequest (cURL)\n\n```\ncurl --request POST \\\n     --url https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/payments \\\n     --header 'X-Idempotency-Key: <Your idempotency-key>' \\\n     --header 'accept: application/json' \\\n     --header 'content-type: application/json' \\\n     --header 'private-secret-key: <Your private-secret-key>' \\\n     --header 'public-api-key: <Your public-api-key>' \\\n     --data '\n{\n    \"description\": \"Test\",\n    \"account_id\": \"{{account-code}}\",\n    \"merchant_order_id\": \"0000023\",\n    \"country\": \"DE\",\n    \"merchant_reference\" : \"reference-{{$randomUUID}}\",\n    \"amount\": {\n        \"currency\": \"EUR\",\n        \"value\": 5000\n    },\n    \"customer_payer\": {\n        \"id\":\"967ecd18-d898-4b88-9400-dd5b01b18edc\"\n    },\n    \"workflow\": \"DIRECT\",\n    \"payment_method\": {\n        \"type\":\"CARD\",\n        \"vaulted_token\": \"eb8caa17-6407-457b-960e-125d8d7a90c1\",\n        \"detail\": {\n           \"card\": {\n               \"stored_credentials\":{\n                  \"reason\":\"CARD_ON_FILE\",\n                  \"usage\": \"USED\",\n                  \"network_transaction_id\":\"583103536844189\"\n              }\n           }\n        }\n    }\n}\n'\n```\n\n## Subscription agreement\n\nFor certain markets (MX for example) and payment processors, when a subscription-related payment is made, the ID of the agreement with the customer needs to be specified in the payment request to ensure correct processing. To facilitate this, we have enabled the `subscription_agreement_id` field inside the `stored_credentials` struct, allowing you to share the agreement made with the customer.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Note\n>\n> The `subscription_agreement_id` and `network_transaction_id` are independent fields. Including a `subscription_agreement_id` does not replace the need for a `network_transaction_id`. Both should be provided when applicable to ensure optimal approval rates and chargeback protection.\n\nJSON\n\n```\n\"payment_method\": {\n        \"type\":\"CARD\",\n        \"vaulted_token\": \"eb8caa17-6407-457b-960e-125d8d7a90c1\",\n        \"detail\": {\n           \"card\": {\n               \"stored_credentials\":{\n                  \"reason\":\"CARD_ON_FILE\",\n                  \"usage\": \"USED\",\n                  \"subscription_agreement_id\":\"AA0001\",\n                  \"network_transaction_id\":\"583103536844189\"\n              }\n           }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n## Network transaction ID\n\nA network transaction ID is a unique identifier assigned to a transaction by the card network. It is used to track and reference specific transactions, particularly in recurring payment scenarios, ensuring consistency and traceability across the payment lifecycle.\n\nIf the transaction is customer-initiated (CIT), the network transaction reference will be available in the `card.stored_credentials.network_transaction_id` field. This field represents the transaction ID for Visa and the trace ID for Mastercard, which are recommended for future subscription payments.\n\nJSON\n\n```\n\"payment_method\": {\n        \"type\":\"CARD\",\n        \"vaulted_token\": \"eb8caa17-6407-457b-960e-125d8d7a90c1\",\n        \"detail\": {\n           \"card\": {\n               \"stored_credentials\":{\n                  \"reason\":\"CARD_ON_FILE\",\n                  \"usage\": \"USED\",\n                  \"network_transaction_id\":\"583103536844189\"\n              }\n           }\n        }\n    }\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nWe associate the `network_transaction_id` with the `vaulted_token` for future transactions, so you don't have to manage the logic for each case. We will perform the association when a payment is created with:\n\n* *Payment method*:\n  + A card `vaulted_token`, or\n  + Card data with `vault_on_success` set to `true`\n* *Stored credentials*:\n  + `usage` set to `FIRST`\n\n> ⚠️\n>\n> When using `vault_on_success = true` in a direct integration, you must create the customer first and pass its `customer_payer.id` in the payment request. Sending customer details inline does not create the customer on Yuno's side, so the card cannot be stored and no `vaulted_token` will be returned.\n\nIf you already have the `network_transaction_id` for the card, you can include it in the payment in the corresponding field. If not, for MIT payments (with `stored_credentials.usage=USED`), we will send the `network_transaction_id` associated with the `vaulted_token` to the provider.\n\n> ❗️\n>\n> Remember to specify the usage in the `stored_credentials` section, as we trigger the `network_transaction_id` logic based on those fields.\n\nUpdated 3 days ago\n\n---\n\n[Smart Retries](/docs/retries)[Transaction Retries](/docs/transaction-retries)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Categorization](#categorization)\n  + [General considerations](#general-considerations)\n  + [Create a payment with processing type](#create-a-payment-with-processing-type)\n  + - [Request example](#request-example)\n  + [Subscription agreement](#subscription-agreement)\n  + [Network transaction ID](#network-transaction-id)\n  + - [Usage](#usage)", "images": [], "source": "Yuno Docs"}
{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/vtex-headless-integration-guide", "title": "VTEX Headless Integration Guide", "content_markdown": "# VTEX Headless Integration Guide\n\nIntegrate Yuno SDK Web for VTEX Headless to handle online payments efficiently. This guide covers installation, configuration, and implementation steps.\n\n## VTEXIO Integration\n\nTo use Yuno in VTEXIO checkout, install the following applications:\n\n* `yunopartnerbr.yuno`: A VTEXIO PPF connector that facilitates integration between VTEX and Yuno's payment infrastructure.\n* `yunopartnerbr.yuno-app`: A VTEXIO frontend payment application is required when using Card or Click to Pay as payment method. It is not required for Pix, Boleto, and other redirect-based payment methods. `yunopartnerbr.yuno-app` has the following key features:\n\n  + Runs the Yuno Web SDK to collect browser data.\n  + Executes third-party fraud detection SDKs.\n  + Processes payments directly within Yuno.\n  + Supports payments with two credit cards.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo integrate **Yuno with VTEX**, you need to install two applications:\n\n* `yunopartnerbr.yuno`: VTEX PPF connector for backend communication.\n* `yunopartnerbr.yuno-app`: Frontend payment application required for card-based payments.\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Admin Permissions Required\n>\n> To install both applications, you need Admin permissions in VTEX.\n\n### Install `yunopartnerbr.yuno`\n\nFollow these steps to install `yunopartnerbr.yuno` in **VTEX Admin**:\n\n1. Log into your [VTEX store account](https://vtex.com).\n2. In the VTEX Admin dashboard, navigate to **Store Settings** > **Providers** and click **New Provider**.\n3. Search for **Yuno** in the list of available providers.\n4. Click **Install** and follow the setup instructions.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/8b9a136e600a017bac069f269c13f2e2d13c5510c81327a33e18db3eac49ce84-image.png)\n\nFor more details, refer to the [Configure Yuno as Provider](../docs/configure-yuno-as-provider) page.\n\n### Install `yunopartnerbr.yuno-app`\n\n`yunopartnerbr.yuno-app` is required for payments using Card or Click to Pay. To install it, follow the steps:\n\n1. In **VTEX Admin**, go to **Apps > App Management**.\n2. Search for **Yuno**.\n3. Locate and select **Yuno Payment App** (the second option in the list).\n4. Click **Install** to complete the setup.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/4902cb86d6c26bee4ac69c17c8eccb5d05d97d59639d1420065f48af77623e10-Install_Yuno_Payment_App_.png)\n\n### Install Yuno SDK Web for VTEX (Optional)\n\nIf your project requires **Yuno SDK Web VTEX**, install it using `npm`:\n\nShell\n\n```\nnpm install @yuno-payments/sdk-web-vtex\n```\n\nThis package simplifies the integration of **SDK Web VTEX** and includes TypeScript support.\n\nTo use the SDK, import and initialize it:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nimport { loadScript } from '@yuno-payments/sdk-web-vtex'\n\n...\n\nconst yunoVTEX = await loadScript()\n\nyunoVTEX.mount({...})\n```\n\nFor additional information, access [@yuno-payments/sdk-web-vtex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yuno-payments/sdk-web-vtex).\n\n## Payment Flows\n\nThe following sections illustrate how payments are processed in VTEXIO and VTEX Headless using different payment methods:\n\n* [Credit Card Payment Flow in VTEXIO](#credit-card-payment-flow-in-vtexio)\n* [Pix (APMs) Payment Flow in VTEXIO](#pix-apms-payment-flow-in-vtexio)\n* [VTEX Headless Payment Flow](#vtex-headless-payment-flow)\n\n### VTEXIO Payment Flows\n\nVTEXIO enables seamless payment processing for various methods, including credit cards and alternative payment methods (APMs) like Pix. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of how these payment flows work.\n\n#### Credit Card Payment Flow in VTEXIO\n\nThis flow details how credit card payments are processed in VTEXIO, from user interaction to transaction completion.\n\n1. The user clicks on the pay button in the VTEXIO frontend.\n2. VTEX backend sends the payment information to the `yunopartnerbr.yuno` connector.\n3. The Yuno connector sends the credit card information to the Yuno API.\n4. The Yuno API returns a one-time token for the payment.\n5. The Yuno connector informs VTEX that the payment app should be opened and provides the one-time token.\n6. VTEXIO opens the Yuno payment app with the data from the Yuno connector.\n7. The user enters credit card details in the Yuno payment app.\n8. Payment details, browser information, and fraud detection data are sent back to the Yuno connector.\n9. The payment is created in Yuno and processed.\n10. The user receives confirmation of the payment status from VTEX.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/ef30b7c45fbb3db4e49c574d6085dd9f242872a3c14ad9f93112631409e3c44a-Diagrama_-_Credit_card_payment_flow_VTEXIO.png)\n\n#### Pix (APMs) Payment Flow in VTEXIO\n\nThis flow explains how Pix and other APMs are handled in VTEXIO, including payment creation and redirection.\n\n1. The user clicks on the pay button in the VTEXIO frontend.\n2. VTEX backend sends the payment information to the `yunopartnerbr.yuno` connector.\n3. The Yuno connector creates the payment in Yuno's system.\n4. Yuno generates a QR code and additional payment details and returns them to VTEX.\n5. VTEXIO opens the Pix application or redirects the user to complete the payment.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/89ce5296e6a38d163c1e5c9936b689477545556e7c42fd2d57561db069d09e06-Diagrama_-_Pix_APM_payment_flow_VTEXIO.png)\n\n### VTEX Headless\n\nTo use Yuno in VTEX Headless checkout, install:\n\n* `yunopartnerbr.yuno`: A VTEXIO PPF connector that runs on the VTEXIO server side.\n\nAdditionally, the [SDK Web VTEX](#installing-and-using-the-sdk-web-vtex) should be implemented. This SDK supports payments with two credit cards.\n\n#### VTEX Headless Payment Flow\n\nVTEX Headless requires a different approach to payment processing. Below are the steps for handling credit card transactions within VTEX Headless.\n\n1. The user clicks on the pay button in the merchant's custom frontend.\n2. VTEX backend sends the payment information to the `yunopartnerbr.yuno` connector.\n3. The Yuno connector sends the credit card information to the Yuno API.\n4. The Yuno API returns a one-time token for the payment.\n5. The Yuno connector informs VTEX that the payment app should be opened and provides the one-time token.\n6. The merchant frontend opens the Yuno SDK Web VTEX using the provided data.\n7. The payment details, browser information, and fraud detection data are sent to the Yuno connector.\n8. The Yuno connector processes the payment by calling the`{{merchant’s domain}}/_v/yunopartnerbr.yuno/v4/payments/yuno`.\n9. The user receives confirmation of the payment status from VTEX.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/4cc5782110e9722bbf3572bb047e010b8a17e471c600b6d6fa3bf64ac3536781-Diagrama_-_Credit_card_payment_flow_VTEX_Headless.png)\n\n## Installing and Using the SDK Web VTEX\n\nThe Yuno SDK Web VTEX allows seamless integration with VTEX’s payment infrastructure, enabling merchants to handle payments directly within their frontend.\n\nTo integrate Yuno SDK Web for VTEX, include the script in your HTML file and configure the necessary parameters:\n\nHTML\n\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <script src=\"https://sdk-web-vtex.y.uno/v1/main.js\"></script>\n</head>\n<body>\n  <div id=\"root-container\"></div>\n  <script>\n    window.YunoVTEX.mount({  \n      elementRoot: \"root-container\",  \n      payload: '{}',  \n      language: 'pt',\n      domainVTEX: 'https://myvtex.yunopartnerbr.com',\n      onPaymentDone: (paymentData) => { console.log(paymentData); },\n      onError: (message, error) => { console.log(message, error); },\n      onLoading: (loading) => { console.log(loading); }\n    });\n  </script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThe following table describes the parameters you can use.\n\n| Property | Type | Description | Required | Example |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `elementRoot` | String | HTML Element ID | True | `\"root-container\"` |\n| `payload` | String | Comes from our connector response | True | `{\"isVTEXCard\":true, \"checkoutSessions\":[\"id\"], \"paymentIds\":[\"id\"], \"orderId\":\"id\"}` |\n| `language` | String | ISO 639-1 language code | True | `\"pt\"` |\n| `domainVTEX` | String | Merchant’s VTEX domain (if different from VTEX) | False | `\"https://myvtex.yunopartnerbr.com\"` |\n| `onLoading` | Function | Called when SDK processes a payment | False | `function(loading) { console.log(loading); }` |\n| `onPaymentDone` | Function | Called when payment is complete | False | `function(paymentResponse) { console.log(paymentResponse); }` |\n| `onError` | Function | Called if an error occurs | False | `function(message, error) { console.log(error); }` |\n\nTo get TypeScript types, install the `npm` package:\n\nShell\n\n```\nnpm install @yuno-payments/sdk-web-vtex\n```\n\n## Payment Response Payloads\n\nWhen processing payments through **Yuno and VTEX**, the `yunopartnerbr.yuno` connector generates a structured payload containing all the necessary transaction details. Below, we provide example payloads for credit card payments and Pix payments (APMs).\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Payload Generation and Structure\n>\n> * Automated Generation: Merchants do not need to modify or format the payload manually.\n> * Dynamic Structure: The payload format adapts based on the selected payment method (credit card, Pix, etc.).\n> * Seamless Integration: The data is retrieved automatically from Yuno's connector when processing transactions in VTEX.\n>\n> For more details, access the [API reference](/reference/create-payment).\n\n### Credit Card Payment Payload\n\nThe following JSON response represents a credit card payment authorization processed through Yuno.\n\nJSON\n\n```\n{\n  \"status\": \"undefined\",\n  \"authorizationId\": null,\n  \"paymentAppData\": {\n

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/headless-sdk-enrollment-ios", "title": "Headless SDK (Enrollment iOS)", "content_markdown": "# Headless SDK (Enrollment iOS)\n\n> 👍\n>\n> ### Recommended SDK\n>\n> We recommend using the [iOS Seamless SDK](seamless-sdk-payment-ios) for a smooth integration experience. This option provides a flexible payment solution with pre-built UI components and customization options.\n\nYuno's Headless iOS SDK lets you enroll in payment methods and tokenize cards, saving them for future use.\n\nThe following steps describe enrolling a payment method using Yuno's Headless SDK.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Enrollment Guide\n>\n> This page provides all the steps for using the Headless SDK to enroll in a payment method. For a comprehensive guide, including customer creation, visit [Headless SDK (Enrollment)](headless-sdk-enrollment-steps).\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo execute the enrollment process, you need to provide the `customer_session` to start the enrollment process in [Step 3](/docs/headless-sdk-enrollment#step-3-start-the-enrollment-process). To acquire the `customer_session`, you need to:\n\n1. **Create a customer**: A customer is required to enroll in payments. Use the [Create Customer](/reference/create-customer) endpoint to create new customers. In the response, you will receive the customer `id`, which you use to create the customer session.\n2. **Create the customer session**: Use the customer `id` and the [Create Customer Session](/reference/create-customer-session) endpoint to receive the `customer_session`.\n\nA complete enrollment process description is covered in [Headless SDK (Enrollment)](/docs/headless-sdk-enrollment-steps).\n\n## Step 1: Include the library in your project\n\nThe first step is to install Yuno SDK to your iOS project.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Check iOS SDK Versions\n>\n> To view all available versions, visit the [release page](https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-ios/releases) on the Yuno iOS SDK repository.\n\nYou can install Yuno SDK in two ways:\n\n* **Cocoapods**: If you do not have a Podfile, follow the [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html) guide to create one. After creating the Podfile, you will integrate the Yuno SDK with Cocoapods by adding the line below to your Podfile:\n\n  Ruby\n\n  ```\n  pod 'YunoSDK', '~> {last_version}'\n  ```\n* **[Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/)**: Set up the Swift package, and then add Yuno SDK as a dependency, as presented in the following code block:\n\n  Swift\n\n  ```\n  dependencies: [\n      .package(url: \"https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-ios.git\", .upToNextMajor(from: \"{last_version}\"))\n  ]\n  ```\n\n## Step 2: Initialize Headless SDK with the public key\n\nTo initialize the Headless SDK, you need to import Yuno and provide a valid **PUBLIC\\_API\\_KEY**. If you don't have your API credentials, access the [Developers (Credentials)](/docs/developers-credentials) page to check how to retrieve them from the dashboard.\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### UISceneDelegate Initialization\n>\n> If your app is using a `UISceneDelegate`, ensure to place your Yuno initialization code within your `SceneDelegate`. [Learn more](#scene-delegate-initialization)\n\nThe code block below presents an example of importing and initializing the `Yuno`.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nimport Yuno\n\nYuno.initialize(\n    apiKey: \"PUBLIC_API_KEY\"\n)\n```\n\n## Step 3: Create a customer session\n\nTo start the enrollment process, you need to provide the `customer_session`. First, you need to create a customer. You need a customer to enroll payments with. Use the [Create Customer](/reference/create-customer) endpoint to create new customers. In the response, you will receive the customer `id`, which you use to create the customer session.\n\nAfter creating the customer, you can create the customer session. Use the customer `id` and the [Create Customer Session](/reference/create-customer-session) endpoint. The `customer_session` will be provided in the response. You need a new `customer_session` every time you enroll in a new payment method.\n\n## Step 4: Create an enrollment payment method object\n\nYou need an enrollment payment method object to set Headless SDK integration for enrollment. You can create one using the [Enroll Payment Method](/reference/enroll-payment-method-checkout) endpoint. While creating the payment method object, you need to define which payment method your customer can enroll in. Currently, only CARD is available for Headless SDK.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Card Verification\n>\n> To verify cards with zero value authorization before enrollment, include the `verify` object when creating the payment method object for the customer session.\n\n## Step 5: Start the enrollment process\n\nNext, you will start the checkout process using the `apiClientEnroll` function, providing the necessary configuration parameters. Parameters\n\nThe following table lists all required parameters and their descriptions.\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `countryCode` | This parameter determines the country for which the payment process is being configured. The complete list of supported countries and their `countryCode` is available on the [Country coverage](/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk) page. |\n| `customer_session` | Refers to the current enrollment's [customer session](/docs/sessions) received as a response to the [Create Customer Session](/reference/create-customer-session) endpoint. Example: '438413b7-4921-41e4-b8f3-28a5a0141638' |\n\nThe next code block presents an example of the parameter configuration.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nvar apiClientEnroll: YunoEnrollHeadless?\n\napiClientEnroll = Yuno.apiClientEnroll(\n    countryCode: \"CO\",\n    customer_session: \"eec6578e-ac2f-40a0-8065-25b5957f6dd3\"\n)\n```\n\n## Step 6: Generate a vaulted token\n\nAfter collecting all user information, you can start the enrollment. First, you need to create a `vaulted_token` using the function `apiClientEnroll.continueEnrollment`. As it is an asynchronous function, you can use `do/catch` to ensure you will correctly handle triggered errors. Below, you will find an example of creating a `vaulted_token`:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nlet enrollmentCollectedData: EnrollmentCollectedData = EnrollmentCollectedData(\n    customerSession: \"eec6578e-ac2f-40a0-8065-25b5957f6dd3\",\n    paymentMethod: CollectedData(\n        type: \"CARD\",\n        card: CardData(\n            detail: CardData.Detail(\n                number: \"4111111111111111\",\n                expirationMonth: 12,\n                expirationYear: 25,\n                securityCode: \"123\",\n                holderName: \"Andrea\",\n                type: .credit\n            )\n        ),\n        customer: Customer()\n    )\n)\n\nlet result = try await apiClientEnroll.continueEnrollment(data: enrollmentCollectedData)\n```\n\nAfter enrolling the new card, you will receive the `vaulted_token`, which you can use to make payments in the future without asking for your customer's card information. The following code block presents an example of a response from the `apiClientEnroll.continueEnrollment` function. The response is a dictionary of type `[String: Any]`.\n\nSwift\n\n```\n[\n vaulted_token: \"9104911d-5df9-429e-8488-ad41abea1a4b\",\n status: \"ENROLLED\",\n\n    EXPIRED,\n    REJECTED,\n   \n READY_TO_ENROLL,\n    ENROLL_IN_PROCESS,\n    UNENROLL_IN_PROCESS,\n    IN_PROCESS,\n    ENROLLED,\n    DECLINED,\n    CANCELED,\n    ERROR,\n    UNENROLLED;\n customer: [\n   session: \"eec6578e-ac2f-40a0-8065-25b5957f6dd3\"\n ]\n]\n```\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Using Webhooks for Enrollment Status\n>\n> Consider using the enrollment status received via [Webhooks](webhooks). Yuno recommends always using this status to base and make business decisions on your platform.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Access the Demo Application\n>\n> In addition to the code examples provided, you can access the [Yuno repository](https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-ios) for a complete implementation of Yuno iOS SDKs.\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Lite SDK (Enrollment iOS)](/docs/enrollment-ios)[Headless SDK (Payment iOS)](/docs/headless-sdk-payment-ios)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Requirements](#requirements)\n  + [Step 1: Include the library in your project](#step-1-include-the-library-in-your-project)\n  + [Step 2: Initialize Headless SDK with the public key](#step-2-initialize-headless-sdk-with-the-public-key)\n  + [Step 3: Create a customer session](#step-3-create-a-customer-session)\n  + [Step 4: Create an enrollment payment method object](#step-4-create-an-enrollment-payment-method-object)\n  + [Step 5: Start the enrollment process](#step-5-start-the-enrollment-process)\n  + [Step 6: Generate a vaulted token](#step-6-generate-a-vaulted-token)", "images": [], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

Additionally, you can define under which circumstances specific payment methods are displayed.\n* **Checkout styling**: Adjust the checkout's visual elements for desktop and mobile devices, including colors and typography. This ensures the checkout experience is consistent with yoru brand.\n\nAny changes made using the Checkout Builder are immediately reflected in the user-facing checkout, providing a straightforward way to manage and adapt the checkout experience to meet your business requirements.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/5a0a03a-manage_checkout_view.png)\n\n## Advantages of using Checkout Builder\n\n* **Customization with no code**: Enjoy the flexibility of tailoring your checkout experience without the need for complex coding. This empowers you to create a checkout process that aligns seamlessly with your brand and business objectives.\n* **Payment method flexibility**: Easily enable, organize, and display the payment methods that best suit your customer base and market.\n* **Intuitive user interface**: Yuno's interface makes it a breeze to configure payment methods, set display conditions, and customize styling.\n\n## Payment method settings\n\nThis module lets you configure and customize the payment methods used in the checkout experience. Beyond activating payment methods, you can adjust the order in which they're displayed, customize their appearance, set required fields, and determine conditions for when each payment method is displayed. This breadth of customization ensures the checkout experience fits your audience and specific use case.\n\nYou must click **Publish settings** on the Checkout Builder to apply all changes to the checkout.\n\n### Conditions\n\nYou can control when a payment method appears at checkout by setting display conditions based on criteria such as the order’s country, amount, currency, or integration metadata. To configure these settings, follow the steps:\n\n1. Next to the payment method, click the three dots icon to open settings and select **Set Conditions**. A pop-up will appear, click **Add new condition** to proceed.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/43f984abb0af8af92f6663229d9c895fdbe233ead7af224052596c6839556b8f-image1.png)\n\n2. In the **Add new condition** section, enter a descriptive name for your condition. Then, select your desired specification such as order country, order current & amount, or metadata. This specification sets the parameters that will trigger your condition. You can select more than one condition at a time.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/ed8aff519e8357a2d530b75585a93cf0b7a1ba7df3f8e605158974efe1b71b6f-image2.png)\n\n3. New options will appear based on the specifications you selected. Fill out the fields to achieve your desired outcome.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/6487abe0715c535247d709a1c8062ff95415f4915a74bae5b70b1154b87e7441-image5.png)\n\n### Required fields\n\nRequired fields specify the information users must provide when using each payment method. Some payment methods require specific data to process payments, and Yuno may request it even if you didn't specify it. Yuno streamlines the process of adding or removing desired fields through its user interface. To configure required fields, click the three dots icon next to each payment method and select **Set Required fields**.\n\nOnce the Required fields menu is open, use the toggle to turn specific fields on and off. Fields required by a provider are enabled by default.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/3367e1a24cd510ba8f56df1f73dacfa07f94478493d8e1a208a16dedfcea9a3e-image4.png)\n\nYou can disable any field, including those required by providers. However, disabling required fields may result in payment failures, so it is essential to verify the provider compatibility before making changes. If a new provider is added to the payment method, any previously disabled required fields will remain disabled, even if required by the new provider. You must manually re-enable these fields if necessary. Therefore, always check the required fields after adding a new provider.\n\nIn the Required fields, you can also configure the behavior for enrolled cards. You can configure whether to request the CVV for every transaction or only during the customer’s first payment.\n\n### Edit name and logo\n\nThe name and logo settings control how a payment methods appear during checkout. This option is unavailable for enrolled payment methods. To adjust these settings:\n\n1. Within **Payment method settings**, click the three dots icon next to any non-enrolled payment method and select **Edit name and logo**.\n2. Select **Use custom settings** to make changes.\n3. Enter your preferred name for the payment method.\n4. Optionally, you can add a description and provide a new logo URL. The URL must start with \"https://\". Use a square image (JPG or PNG), 100x100 pixels in size, and up tp 10 KB.\n5. Click **Save changes**, followed by **Publish settings** to apply all changes.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/592162ae53722d2676c56066ea67eeeb09a7caab0c8abbea29e66231035e38d2-image3.png)\n\n## Checkout styling\n\nMatch your brand's unique look and feel using the Checkout Styling module.

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/headless-sdk-payment-ios", "title": "Headless SDK (Payment iOS)", "content_markdown": "# Headless SDK (Payment iOS)\n\n> 👍\n>\n> ### Recommended SDK\n>\n> We recommend using the [iOS Seamless SDK](seamless-sdk-payment-ios) for a smooth integration experience. This option provides a flexible payment solution with pre-built UI components and customization options.\n\nYuno's Headless iOS SDK lets you create payments and enroll payment methods simultaneously. Note that when using the Headless SDK, you will need to request and send via API all the mandatory fields the payment provider requires to generate payment in their API.\n\nYuno's Headless SDK enables you to create payments in two different scenarios:\n\n* Create a [One-Time Use Token](/docs/tokens) using credit card information or alternative payment methods, then create a payment.\n* Create a [One-Time Use Token](/docs/tokens) using a `vaulted_token` from a previously enrolled payment method to collect relevant information for fraud providers, then create a payment.\n\nThe following steps describe creating a payment using Yuno's Headless SDK.\n\n## Step 1: Include the library in your project\n\nThe first step is to install Yuno SDK to your iOS project.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Check iOS SDK Versions\n>\n> To view all available versions, visit the [release page](https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-ios/releases) on the Yuno iOS SDK repository.\n\nYou can install Yuno SDK in two ways:\n\n* **Cocoapods**: If you do not have a Podfile, follow the [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html) guide to create one. After creating the Podfile, you will integrate the Yuno SDK with Cocoapods by adding the line below to your Podfile:\n\n  Ruby\n\n  ```\n  pod 'YunoSDK', '~> {last_version}'\n  ```\n* **[Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/)**: Set up the Swift package, and then add Yuno SDK as a dependency, as presented in the following code block:\n\n  Swift\n\n  ```\n  dependencies: [\n      .package(url: \"https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-ios.git\", .upToNextMajor(from: \"{last_version}\"))\n  ]\n  ```\n\n## Step 2: Initialize Headless SDK with the public key\n\nTo initialize the Headless SDK, you need to import Yuno and provide a valid **PUBLIC\\_API\\_KEY**. If you don't have your API credentials, access the [Developers (Credentials)](/docs/developers-credentials) page to check how to retrieve them from the dashboard.\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### UISceneDelegate Initialization\n>\n> If your app is using a `UISceneDelegate`, ensure to place your Yuno initialization code within your `SceneDelegate`. [Learn more](#scene-delegate-initialization)\n\nThe code block below presents an example of importing and initializing the `Yuno`.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nimport YunoSDK\n\nYuno.initialize(\n    apiKey: \"PUBLIC_API_KEY\"\n)\n```\n\n## Step 3: Start the checkout process\n\nNext, you will start the checkout process using the `apiClientPayment` function, providing the necessary configuration parameters. You need to call this function once your customer selects the payment method. As a result, the SDK will start collecting relevant information for 3DS and fraud prevention tools you have configured in your [routing](/docs/routing).\n\nParameters\n\nThe following table lists all required parameters and their descriptions.\n\n| Parameter | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `countryCode` | This parameter determines the country for which the payment process is being configured. The complete list of supported countries and their `countryCode` is available on the [Country coverage](/docs/country-coverage-yuno-sdk) page. |\n| `checkout_session` | Refers to the current payment's checkout session created using the [Create Checkout Session](/reference/create-checkout-session) endpoint. Example: '438413b7-4921-41e4-b8f3-28a5a0141638' |\n\nThe following code block presents an example of the parameter configuration.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nvar apiClientPayment: YunoPaymentHeadless?\n\napiClientPayment = Yuno.apiClientPayment(\n    countryCode: \"CO\",\n    checkoutSession: \"438413b7-4921-41e4-b8f3-28a5a0141638\"\n)\n```\n\n## Step 4: Generate token\n\nAfter collecting all user information, you can start the payment. First, you need to create a one-time token (OTT) using the function `apiClientPayment.generateToken`. As it is an asynchronous function, you can use `do/catch` to ensure you will correctly handle triggered errors. Below, you will find two examples of different scenarios to create a one-time token:\n\n1. **Example 1**: Create a one-time token utilizing a card as the payment method and including all requisite card information.\n2. **Example 2**: Create a one-time token using the `vaulted_token` information.\n\n> 👍\n>\n> ### Advantages of Using a Vaulted Token\n>\n> Utilizing a vaulted token with the SDK ensures that all fraud information from your configured providers is collected and attached to the one-time token. Additionally, you can include installment details and a security code if required by the provider.\n\nSwiftSwift\n\n```\nlet tokenCollectedData: TokenCollectedData = TokenCollectedData(\n    checkoutSession: \"438413b7-4921-41e4-b8f3-28a5a0141638\",\n    paymentMethod: CollectedData(\n        type: \"CARD\",\n        vaultedToken: nil,\n        card: CardData(\n            save: true,\n            detail: CardData.Detail(\n                number: \"4111111111111111\",\n                expirationMonth: 12,\n                expirationYear: 25,\n                securityCode: \"123\",\n                holderName: \"Andrea\",\n                type: .credit\n            ),\n            installment: CardData.Installment(\n                id: \"64ceacef-0886-4c81-9779-b2b3029c4e8b\",\n                value: 1\n            )\n        ),\n        customer: Customer()\n    )\n)\n\nlet result = try await apiClientPayment.generateToken(\n    data: tokenCollectedData\n)\n```\n\n```\nlet tokenCollectedData: TokenCollectedData = TokenCollectedData(\n    checkoutSession: \"438413b7-4921-41e4-b8f3-28a5a0141638\",\n    paymentMethod: CollectedData(\n        type: \"CARD\",\n        vaultedToken: \"c8bb2bd8-8abf-4265-b478-0ec4e3c10cd5\",\n        card: CardData(\n            installment: CardData.Installment(\n                id: \"64ceacef-0886-4c81-9779-b2b3029c4e8b\",\n                value: 1\n            )\n        ),\n        customer: Customer()\n    )\n)\n\nlet result = try await apiClientPayment.generateToken(\n    data: tokenCollectedData\n)\n```\n\nThe following code block presents the `apiClientPayment.generateToken` function responses for both examples above. The response is a dictionary of type `[String: Any]`.\n\nExample 1Example 2\n\n```\n [\"token\": \"9ee44ac7-9134-4598-ae28-a26fec03099d\",\n     \"type\": \"CARD\",\n     \"customer\": [\"billing_address\": nil,\n                  \"first_name\": nil,\n                  \"gender\": \"\",\n                  \"phone\": nil,\n                  \"browser_info\": [\"color_depth\": nil,\n                                   \"language\": \"en\",\n                                   \"accept_header\": \"*/*\",\n                                   \"browser_time_difference\": nil,\n                                   \"accept_content\": nil,\n                                   \"accept_browser\": nil,\n                                   \"java_enabled\": nil,\n                                   \"user_agent\": \"YunoSDK_Example/1 CFNetwork/1406.0.4 Darwin/22.6.0\",\n                                   \"screen_height\": \"844.0\",\n                                   \"screen_width\": \"390.0\",\n                                   \"javascript_enabled\": nil],\n                  \"document\": nil,\n                  \"last_name\": nil,\n                  \"device_fingerprint\": nil,\n                  \"email\": nil],\n     \"country\": \"BR\",\n     \"vaulted_token\": nil,\n     \"installment\": [\"rate\": \"\",\n                     \"id\": \"cca80084-961b-4212-9c34-54f03f4f10ae\",\n                     \"value\": 24,\n                     \"amount\": nil],\n     \"card_data\": nil]\n```\n\n```\n[\"token\": \"9ee44ac7-9134-4598-ae28-a26fec03099d\",\n     \"type\": \"CARD\",\n     \"customer\": [\"billing_address\": nil,\n                  \"first_name\": nil,\n                  \"gender\": \"\",\n                  \"phone\": nil,\n                  \"browser_info\": [\"color_depth\": nil,\n                                   \"language\": \"en\",\n                                   \"accept_header\": \"*/*\",\n                                   \"browser_time_difference\": nil,\n                                   \"accept_content\": nil,\n                                   \"accept_browser\": nil,\n                                   \"java_enabled\": nil,\n                                   \"user_agent\": \"YunoSDK_Example/1 CFNetwork/1406.0.4 Darwin/22.6.0\",\n                                   \"screen_height\": \"844.0\",\n                                   \"screen_width\": \"390.0\",\n                                   \"javascript_enabled\": nil],\n                  \"document\": nil,\n                  \"last_name\": nil,\n                  \"device_fingerprint\": nil,\n                  \"email\": nil],\n     \"country\": \"BR\",\n     \"vaulted_token\": \"a1c7c5d1-b260-4dc6-909a-8368704233cf\",\n     \"installment\": [\"rate\": \"\",\n                     \"id\": \"cca80084-961b-4212-9c34-54f03f4f10ae\",\n                     \"value\": 24,\n                     \"amount\": nil],\n     \"card_data\": nil]\n```\n\n## Step 5: Create the payment\n\nOnce you have completed the steps described before, you can create a payment. The back-to-back payment creation must be carried out using the [Create Payment endpoint](/reference/create-payment). The merchant should call their backend to create the payment within Yuno, using the one-time token and the checkout session.\n\nThe endpoint response provides the `sdk_action_required` parameter, which indicates if additional actions are needed to complete the payment:\n\n* If the customer selects a synchronous payment method, the payment is completed instantly. In this case, the `sdk_action_required` field in the API response will be `false`, and the payment process concludes at this step. While it is not mandatory to call the `continuePayment` method in this case, it is recommended to ensure proper handling.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Using continuePayment Method\n>\n> If `sdk_action_required = false`, you can call the `Yuno.continuePayment()` method, and Yuno will handle the final process to complete the payment.\n\n* If the payment requires further interaction from the SDK to complete the flow, `sdk_action_required` will be `true`. In this case, proceed with Step 6 for instructions.\n\n## Step 6: Process asynchronous payments (Optional)\n\nA payment with 3DS may require an additional challenge to check the customer's identity, as described on the [3DS Card Verification](/docs/3ds-1) page. If an 3DS verification challenge is necessary, the [Create Payment](/reference/create-payment) endpoint response will contain:\n\n* Status equal to `PENDING` and sub status equal to `WAITING_ADDITIONAL_STEP`\n* `sdk_action_required = true`\n* A `redirect_url` defined in `payment.payment_method.payment_method_detail.card`\n\nTo perform the challenge and finish the payment, you have two integration options:\n\n* (Recommended by Yuno) [Integrate the SDK `continuePayment` method](#integrate-the-continuepayment-method-recommended)\n* [Get the 3DS challenge URL](#get-the-3ds-challenge-url)\n\n### Integrate the `continuePayment` method (Recommended)\n\nIf you choose to use the `continuePayment` method, Yuno SDK will take care of displaying the additional screens for the customers complete the 3DS challenge, where they can carry out the necessary actions to complete the payment.\n\nTo use the `continuePayment`, you need to perform the following call:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nYuno.continuePayment(showPaymentStatus: Bool)\n```\n\nThe parameter `showPaymentStatus` is used to determine whether the payment status should be displayed. By passing `true` as an argument, the payment will be displayed on the screen.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Default Value for showPaymentStatus\n>\n> In Yuno's iOS Headless SDK, the default value for `showPaymentStatus` is `true`. [Learn more](#showPaymentStatus)\n\n### Get the 3DS challenge URL\n\nIf you are not using the `continuePayment` method, you need to redirect your customer to the challenge URL by your self. To get the 3DS challenge URL, you need to call the `getThreeDSecureChallenge` function, providing the `checkoutSession`. The `checkoutSession` is only required if you aren't using the one used to create the payment. Below, you will find an example of using the `getThreeDSecureChallenge` function. As `getThreeDSecureChallenge` is an asynchronous function, you can use `do/catch`  to ensure you will correctly handle triggered errors.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nfunc getThreeDSecureChallenge(checkoutSession: String?) async throws -> ThreeDSecureChallengeResponse\n```\n\nThe `getThreeDSecureChallenge` function will return the `ThreeDSecureChallengeResponse`, presented in the next code block:\n\nSwift\n\n```\npublic struct ThreeDSecureChallengeResponse {\n    public let url: String\n}\n```\n\nThe `url` will contain a valid URL you need to redirect your customer to complete the challenge.\n\nYou are responsible for redirecting your customers to the URL provided by the `getThreeDSecureChallenge()` function to complete the challenge. Once the customer successfully completes the 3DS challenge, they will be automatically redirected to the `callback_url`, which you provided when creating the `checkout_session` with the [Create Checkout Session](/reference/create-checkout-session) endpoint.\n\nTo confirm the challenge was completed, you can open a web view to load the provided URL and listen for the `messageFromWeb` event. Below is an example code demonstrating how to listen for this event.\n\nSwift\n\n```\nclass HeadlessWebView: UIViewController, WKScriptMessageHandler, WKNavigationDelegate {\n\n    private var webView: WKWebView!\n    private var url: String = \"\"\n    private let configuration = WKWebViewConfiguration()\n\n    init(url: String) {\n        self.url = url\n        super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)\n    }\n\n    required init?(coder: NSCoder) {\n        nil\n    }\n\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n        view.backgroundColor = .white\n        webViewConfig()\n    }\n\n    func webViewConfig() {\n   \n        configuration.preferences.javaScriptEnabled = true\n        configuration.userContentController.add(self, name: \"messageFromWeb\")\n        webView = WKWebView(frame: view.bounds, configuration: configuration)\n        webView.navigationDelegate = self\n\n        guard let url = URL(string: url) else {\n            return\n        }\n        let request = URLRequest(url: url)\n        webView.load(request)\n\n    }\n\n    func userContentController(_ userContentController: WKUserContentController, didReceive message: WKScriptMessage) {\n        if message.name == \"messageFromWeb\", let messageBody = message.body as? String {\n            self.dismiss(animated: true)\n\n        }\n    }\n\n    override func viewDidDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {\n        super.viewDidDisappear(animated)\n        self.configuration.userContentController.removeScriptMessageHandler(forName: \"messageFromWeb\")\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\nThe response will inform the challenge status, which can be `COMPLETED` or `ERROR`. The next code block presents examples for each possible option.\n\nCOMPLETEDERROR\n\n```\n{\n   \"origin\":\"CHALLENGE\",\n   \"status\":\"COMPLETED\",\n   \"data\":\"callback_url\"\n}\n```\n\n```\n{\n   \"origin\":\"CHALLENGE\",\n   \"status\":\"ERROR\",\n   \"data\":\"Invalid 3DS provider\"\n}\n```\n\nTo complete the Headless SDK payment flow, you need to use [Yuno Webhooks](/docs/configure-webhooks), which will promptly notify you about the outcome of the 3DS challenge and the final payment status. Using webhooks ensures that you receive real-time updates on the progress of the payment transaction. In addition to the webhooks, you can retrieve the payment information using the [Retrieve Payment by ID](/reference/retrieve-payment-by-id) endpoint.\n\nTo finish the payment implementation and understand the remaining steps, access [Headless SDK (Payment)](/docs/headless-sdk-integration).\n\n## Step 7: Handle Payment Status (Optional)\n\n> 🚧\n>\n> ### Deep Links and Mercado Pago Checkout Pro\n>\n> This step is only required if you're using a payment method that relies on deep links or Mercado Pago Checkout Pro. If your payment methods don't use deep links, you can skip this step.\n\nSome payment methods take users out of your app to complete the transaction. Once the payment is finished, the user is redirected back to your app using a deep link. The SDK uses this deep link to check what happened, checking if the payment was successful, failed, or canceled, and can show a status screen to the user.\n\nTo handle this, you need to update your `AppDelegate` to pass the incoming URL back to the Yuno SDK. This lets the SDK read the result and optionally display the payment status. The following code snippet shows how you can add it to your app:\n\nSwift\n\n```\nfunc application(_ app: UIApplication,\n                 open url: URL,\n                 options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey : Any] = [:]) -> Bool {\n\n  guard url.scheme == \"yunoexample\" else { return false }\n\n  return Yuno.receiveDeeplink(url, showStatusView: true)\n}\n```\n\nThis code listens for deep links that open your app. When a URL is received, it checks if the scheme matches the one you used in the `callback_url` during checkout session setup. If it matches, the URL is passed to the Yuno SDK using `Yuno.receiveDeeplink(...)`. The SDK then reads the payment result and, if `showStatusView` is set to `true`, shows the appropriate status screen to the user.\n\nMake sure the `url.scheme` in this code matches the `callback_url` you provided when creating the `checkout_session`.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Demo App\n>\n> In addition to the code examples provided, you can access the [Yuno repository](https://github.com/yuno-payments/yuno-sdk-ios) for a complete implementation of Yuno iOS SDKs.\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Headless SDK (Enrollment iOS)](/docs/headless-sdk-enrollment-ios)[ClearSale SDK (iOS)](/docs/clearsale-sdk-ios)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Step 1: Include the library in your project](#step-1-include-the-library-in-your-project)\n  + [Step 2: Initialize Headless SDK with the public key](#step-2-initialize-headless-sdk-with-the-public-key)\n  + [Step 3: Start the checkout process](#step-3-start-the-checkout-process)\n  + [Step 4: Generate token](#step-4-generate-token)\n  + [Step 5: Create the payment](#step-5-create-the-payment)\n  + [Step 6: Process asynchronous payments (Optional)](#step-6-process-asynchronous-payments-optional)\n  + - [Integrate the continuePayment method (Recommended)](#integrate-the-continuepayment-method-recommended)\n    - [Get the 3DS challenge URL](#get-the-3ds-challenge-url)\n  + [Step 7: Handle Payment Status (Optional)](#step-7-handle-payment-status-optional)", "images": [], "source": "Yuno Docs"}
{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/fingerprint", "title": "Card Fingerprint", "content_markdown": "# Card Fingerprint\n\nWe've added a new field to the Payment method object called `fingerprint`. It is a field that represents your customer's card throughout your organization. When a customer enrolls a credit card multiple times related to one or many Yuno accounts, multiple `vaulted_tokens` will be generated, but the fingerprint lets you identify when the same card is in different scenarios.\n\nJSON\n\n```\n\"card_data\": {\n                    \"holder_name\": \"John Doe\",\n                    \"iin\": \"41111111\",\n                    \"lfd\": \"1111\",\n                    \"number_length\": 16,\n                    \"security_code_length\": 3,\n                    \"brand\": \"VISA\",\n                    \"issuer_name\": \"JPMORGAN CHASE BANK N A\",\n                    \"category\": \"CREDIT\",\n                    \"type\": \"CREDIT\",\n                    \"fingerprint\": \"d244e20d-43a1-43f7-9b48-0a76423be35e\"\n                },\n```\n\nFingerprinting involves creating an identifier for a specific payment method without disclosing any sensitive information.

This option provides a flexible payment solution with pre-built UI components and customization options.\n\nThis page provides a guide to get started with Yuno's Lite SDK (Web) payment solutions. Whether you're looking to implement your first payment integration or enhance your existing setup, this guide provides all the information you need to create a seamless payment experience for your users.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Web SDK Release\n>\n> This is the latest version with enhanced UI grouping and multilingual support.\n\n## Choose your integration method\n\nChoose the integration method that best fits your needs. Each approach has specific advantages, and selecting the right one depends on your development environment, technical requirements, and preferences.\n\n* **[Method 1 (HTML)](#1-add-the-sdk-script-directly-in-html)**: Add a single script tag to your HTML file. This is the simplest method, ideal for basic implementations and quick prototypes\n* **[Method 2 (Dynamic JavaScript)](#2-inject-the-sdk-dynamically-using-javascript)**: Load the SDK programmatically with custom error handling and loading states. Best for applications needing more control over the integration\n* **[Method 3 (NPM)](#3-use-the-npm-module)**: Use our NPM package in modern JavaScript applications. This is our recommended approach, with dependency management, tree-shaking, and TypeScript support\n\n### 1. Add the SDK script directly in HTML\n\nAdd a `<script>` tag to your HTML file to integrate the Yuno SDK. This method provides a quick implementation while maintaining proper asynchronous loading. The SDK exposes an event that notifies when it's fully loaded, ensuring you can safely initialize and use its features at the right time.\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Event Listener Timing\n>\n> While the `defer` attribute ensures the script is executed after the HTML is parsed, it doesn't guarantee that the SDK script will always load last. In some cases, if the SDK loads faster than expected and the event listener is declared afterward, the `yuno-sdk-ready` event may have already fired — and your listener won't catch it. To prevent this, always define the listener before loading the SDK script.\n\nHTML\n\n```\n<script>\n  window.addEventListener('yuno-sdk-ready', () => {\n    console.log('SDK loaded');\n    await yuno.initialize('publicKey');\n  });\n</script>\n\n<script defer src=\"https://sdk-web.y.uno/v1.1/main.js\"></script>\n```\n\n### 2. Inject the SDK dynamically using JavaScript\n\nThe dynamic JavaScript injection method provides enhanced control over SDK loading and initialization. This approach enables you to:\n\n* Load the SDK programmatically when needed\n* Implement custom loading states and error handling\n* Precisely control when the SDK becomes available\n* Synchronize SDK initialization with your application logic\n* Create tailored error handling for your use case\n\nThis method is ideal when you need granular control over the SDK's loading process and want to handle various scenarios with precision.\n\nCreate a function to inject the SDK dynamically:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nexport const injectScript = async (): Promise<boolean> => {\n  const head = document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0];\n  const js = document.createElement('script');\n  js.src = \"https://sdk-web.y.uno/v1.1/main.js\";\n  js.defer = true;\n\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    window.addEventListener('yuno-sdk-ready', () => {\n      resolve(true);\n    });\n\n    js.onerror = (error) => {\n      const event = new CustomEvent('yuno-sdk-error', { detail: error });\n      window.dispatchEvent(event);\n      reject(new Error(`Failed to load script: ${js.src} - ${error.message}`));\n    };\n\n    head.appendChild(js);\n  });\n};\n```\n\nUse the function to inject the SDK:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nawait injectScript();\nawait yuno.initialize('publicKey');\n```\n\n### 3. Use the NPM module\n\nInstall the SDK as a module through NPM for projects using NPM package management. This approach provides better dependency management, version control, and seamless integration with modern JavaScript build tools and frameworks. It's particularly beneficial for applications using bundlers like webpack, Rollup, or Vite.\n\nBash\n\n```\nnpm install @yuno-payments/sdk-web\n```\n\nThen, load and initialize the SDK:\n\nJavaScript\n\n```\nimport { loadScript } from '@yuno-payments/sdk-web';\n\nconst yuno = await loadScript();\nawait yuno.initialize('publicKey');\n```\n\n## Improve performance using `preconnect`\n\nAdd `preconnect` links as early as possible within the `<head>` tag of your HTML document to optimize performance and reduce latency. These links allow browsers to quickly connect to our servers before resources are actually requested. This proactive approach can significantly improve loading times, especially for the initial SDK setup and subsequent API calls.\n\nHTML\n\n```\n<link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://sdk-web.y.uno\" />\n<link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://api.y.uno\" />\n<link rel=\"preconnect\" href=\"https://sdk-web-card.prod.y.uno\" />\n```\n\n## Lite SDK implementation\n\nAfter integrating the SDK using one of the methods described above, follow these steps to implement the Lite Checkout functionality:\n\n[#### Lite Web SDK (Enrollment)](../docs/enrollment-lite-sdk)[#### Lite Web SDK (Payment)](../docs/lite-web-sdk-payment)\n\n## Stay Updated\n\nVisit the [changelog](/changelog) for the latest SDK updates and version history.\n\nUpdated about 1 month ago\n\n---\n\n[Full SDK (Web) Implementation](/docs/full-sdk-implementation)[Lite SDK (Enrollment Web)](/docs/enrollment-lite-sdk)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Choose your integration method](#choose-your-integration-method)\n  + - [1.

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/split-payments-marketplace", "title": "Split Payments Marketplace", "content_markdown": "# Split Payments Marketplace\n\nThis feature allows **merchants to split payments among multiple recipients**, which is particularly useful for marketplace models where transactions need to be divided among different sellers or stakeholders. Merchants can specify how the payment is split, including the amounts, recipients, and any applicable fees.\n\nThe split payment functionality depends on the support of the selected payment provider. Yuno acts solely as the orchestrator of the payment, not the processor. Ensure your provider supports split payments before using this functionality.\n\n## Key features\n\nThe key features of the split payments marketplace include:\n\n* **Split payments**: Define how the total payment amount is distributed among different recipients.\n* **Flexible configuration**: Supports absolute-based splits.\n* **Integration with providers**: Splits can be executed by payment providers that support this functionality.\n* **Detailed handling of fees**: The system allows for fine-tuning of how transaction fees and chargebacks are managed.\n* **Onboarding transfer**: Allows the transfer of onboardings between different recipients.\n\nTo use this feature, you must **first onboard your recipients** for the payment split, and **then create the payment** specifying the necessary information.\n\n## 1. Onboarding\n\nYuno's onboarding model is crafted to assist marketplaces in seamlessly connecting and managing their **submerchants** across **multiple payment providers**. Central to this system is the **recipient object**, which represents each individual submerchant within the marketplace ecosystem.\n\n* Each **marketplace owner** is represented in **Yuno as an organization**.\n* Within an organization, one or more accounts can be created, each configured with its own set of **connections** to payment providers (e.g., Stripe, Adyen, dLocal).\n* For every account, the marketplace can register one or more **recipients** — these are the submerchants to be onboarded.\n* Each **recipient** is then linked individually to one or more **connections**, depending on which payment processors they will use.\n\nThis **architecture** enables:\n\n* A single, unified onboarding process.\n* Independent status tracking per provider.\n* Easy scaling of submerchant operations across providers.\n\nThis design ensures flexibility, transparency, and full traceability throughout the onboarding lifecycle. The [recipients endpoint](/reference/create-recipient-1) is used to create and manage each submerchant profile and to trigger the corresponding provider-specific onboarding workflows.\n\n### Onboarding flows\n\nYuno offers two onboarding flows for submerchants, providing flexibility based on the submerchant's current status with payment providers.\n\n1. **Pre-onboarded accounts**: If a submerchant has already completed the onboarding process with a specific provider (e.g., through an external dashboard or platform), the marketplace can supply the corresponding `recipient_id` during creation. In this scenario, no further onboarding is required, and the status will be immediately set to `SUCCEEDED` (`onboardings.type`=`PREVIOUSLY_ONBOARDED`).\n2. **Dynamic onboarding**: If no credentials are provided, Yuno will initiate the onboarding process for the chosen provider (`onboardings.type`=`ONE_STEP_ONBOARDING` or `TWO_STEP_ONBOARDING`). This process may include:\n\n   1. Form submission or redirection to a hosted onboarding page.\n   2. Uploading legal or financial documentation.\n   3. Completing KYC/KYB validation steps.\n\nThroughout the onboarding lifecycle, a recipient may experience various statuses that reflect the current state of the process:\n\n| Status | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `CREATED` | Initial state after creation; onboarding process not yet started. |\n| `PENDING` | Awaiting provider review after data submission. |\n| `SUCCEEDED` | The recipient is fully onboarded and active. |\n| `DECLINED` | The onboarding was rejected by the provider and cannot be retried. |\n| `BLOCKED` | The provider has explicitly blocked the onboarding due to compliance issues. |\n| `CANCELED` | The onboarding process was voluntarily canceled before completion. |\n| `REJECTED` | The onboarding failed due to incorrect data or failed validations. |\n| `ERROR` | A technical error occurred during the onboarding flow. |\n\nThese statuses assist the marketplace in understanding the onboarding lifecycle and implementing appropriate retry, alert, or fallback mechanisms when necessary.\n\nThis flexible approach allows marketplaces to tailor the onboarding process to their operational needs, maintaining control and visibility.\n\n### Workflow\n\nThe onboarding workflow follows a structured process that ensures submerchants are properly integrated into the marketplace ecosystem. The diagram below illustrates the complete flow from initial setup to payment processing.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/31facc62a78859a26c990685ad3fab72e3a495f88376388ebbe9b52227a5b267-onboardings-workflow.png)\n\n**Workflow Steps:**\n\n1. **Organization & Account Setup**: The marketplace owner creates an organization in Yuno and configures accounts with payment provider connections.\n2. **Recipient Creation**: For each submerchant, the marketplace creates a recipient using the [Create Recipients API](/reference/create-recipient-1) endpoint, specifying either:\n\n   * `provider_recipient_id` for pre-onboarded submerchants\n   * Provider connection details for new onboarding\n3. **Onboarding Execution**:\n\n   * **Pre-onboarded**: Status immediately becomes `SUCCEEDED`\n   * **New onboarding**: Yuno initiates provider-specific flow with status progression from `CREATED` → `PENDING` → `SUCCEEDED`\n4. **Payment Creation**: Once recipients are successfully onboarded (`SUCCEEDED` status), the marketplace can create payments with the `split_marketplace` object.\n5. **Split Processing**: The payment provider executes the split according to the defined distribution, transferring funds to each recipient's designated share.\n\n## 2. Payment split integration\n\nIn this section, we explore how the `split_marketplace` object is used to divide a [payment](/reference/create-payment) among multiple recipients. This object is an array where each entry specifies a recipient and their corresponding share of the payment.\n\n> ℹ️\n>\n> In this step, reference recipients created in Step 1 (Onboarding).\n>\n> For `type` = `PURCHASE` or `MARKETPLACE`, include the `recipient_id` of that recipient.\n>\n> For `PAYMENTFEE`, `VAT` and `COMMISSION`, `recipient_id` is optional.\n\n| Field | Type | Description | Mandatory | Example Value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| `recipient_id` | `string` | The unique identifier for the recipient within the  Use the ID of a recipient created in Step 1 (Onboarding) when `type` is `PURCHASE` or `MARKETPLACE`. | Conditional | `rec_test123` |\n| `provider_recipient_id` | `string` | The recipient's ID as provided by the payment provider, if applicable. | Conditional | `prov_rec_abc` |\n| **Note:** |  | You must provide either `recipient_id` or `provider_recipient_id`.  For marketplace owners (`type`=`COMMISSION`), `provider_recipient_id` is optional if not required by the provider. |  |  |\n| `type`\\* | `enum` | The transaction detail item type. Options include `PURCHASE`, `PAYMENTFEE`, `VAT`, `COMMISSION`, `MARKETPLACE`.  `recipient_id` is mandatory for `PURCHASE` and `MARKETPLACE`. | Conditional | `PURCHASE` |\n| **Note:** |  | **Propagation considerations**   * Items are sent to the provider only if it supports transmitting details * These types do not affect fund disbursement, they are merely informational when the provider allows it |  |  |\n| `merchant_reference` | `string` | An identifier for the payment transaction. This is optional. If not specified, the main payment's merchant reference will be used for all split transactions. (MAX 255; MIN 3 characters). | No | `AAB01-432245` |\n| `amount`\\* | `struct` | Specifies the amount for the split. | Yes |  |\n| `value`\\* | `number` | The monetary value of the split (e.g., 7500 for 75.00). | Yes | `7500` |\n| `currency`\\* | `enum` | The currency in which the payment is made (ISO 4217, 3 characters). | Yes | `COP` |\n| `liability` | `struct` | Information about the recipient's liability for fees and chargebacks, if applicable. | No |  |\n| `processing_fee` | `enum` | Specifies who is responsible for the transaction fee: `MERCHANT`, `RECIPIENT`, `SHARED`. | No | `MERCHANT` |\n| `chargebacks` | `boolean` | Indicates if the recipient is liable for chargebacks (`true` if they are responsible). | No | `false` |\n\n  \n\nExample using provider recipients directly\n\n```\n{\n  \"split_marketplace\": [\n    {\n      \"provider_recipient_id\": \"recipient_123\",\n      \"type\": \"PURCHASE\",\n      \"amount\": {\n        \"value\": 750,\n        \"currency\": \"EUR\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"COMMISSION\",\n      \"amount\": {\n        \"value\": 30,\n        \"currency\": \"EUR\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExample using Yuno recipients\n\n```\n{\n  \"split_marketplace\": [\n    {\n      \"recipient_id\": \"4b31a9b8-4cd2-4e47-93cf-03729241bd68\",\n      \"type\": \"PURCHASE\",\n      \"amount\": {\n        \"value\": 750,\n        \"currency\": \"EUR\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"recipient_id\": \"9104911d-5df9-429e-8488-ad41abea1a4b\",\n      \"type\": \"COMMISSION\",\n      \"amount\": {\n        \"value\": 30,\n        \"currency\": \"EUR\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## 3. Onboarding transfer\n\nThe goal of this flow is to allow the transfer of onboardings between recipients in a controlled and reversible way.\n\nThe process has several stages. First, the initial recipient is created with its onboarding (a prior step). Later, when a transfer is required, follow the steps to create the new recipient, use the transfer service, and, if needed, reverse the operation.\n\n1. **Recipient and onboarding (before any transfer)**: [Create recipient](/reference/create-recipient-1), then [create onboarding](/reference/create-onboarding).\n\n> 📘\n>\n> This step happens in advance when a new recipient is created and its onboarding is assigned. It is not part of the transfer itself.\n\nIf you decide to transfer the onboarding to another recipient, continue the flow:\n\n2. **Create the new recipient and onboarding**: Use the [create recipient](/reference/create-recipient-1) and [create onboarding](/reference/create-onboarding) endpoints to set up the recipient and onboarding that will receive the transfer.\n3. **Transfer the onboarding**: Use [transfer onboarding](/reference/transfer-onboarding) and include:\n\n   * `recipient_id`: the target recipient ID\n   * `onboarding_id`: the onboarding to transfer\n\n   The onboarding will be transferred to the new recipient.\n4. **Reverse the transfer (optional)**: Use [reverse onboarding](/reference/reverse-onboarding) to revert the previous transfer, providing the same `recipient_id` and `onboarding_id`.\n\nThe `onboarding` object includes a `history` element that stores the complete traceability of the onboarding. This history includes not only updates to the object but also events related to transfers between recipients, ensuring full lifecycle visibility.\n\n## Validations\n\nIn this section, we outline the necessary validations to ensure successful split payments.\n\n* The total of all splits must match the overall payment amount.\n* For each split, an object must be sent for every participant, ensuring the sum of amounts equals the total payment amount.\n* In scenarios where a direct recipient ID is not needed for the marketplace owner (e.g., with Adyen), the `type` field can serve as a flag (e.g., `COMMISSION`) to denote the marketplace owner's share, making the `provider_recipient_id` optional for that specific split.\n* Either `recipient_id` or `provider_recipient_id` must be included for the split, but not both.\n* If any required fields are missing or invalid, the request will result in an error.\n* If using multiple payment providers for split payments, we recommend utilizing the [recipients object](/reference/create-recipients), as it allows defining more than one provider for each recipient.\n\n## API endpoints involved\n\nThis section lists the API endpoints involved in managing split payments.\n\n* **[Create recipients](/reference/create-recipient-1)**: **POST**: `https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/recipients`\n* **[Create onboarding](/reference/create-onboarding)**: **POST**: `https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/recipients/{recipient_id}/onboardings`\n* **[Continue onboarding](/reference/continue-onboarding)**: **POST**: `https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/recipients/{recipient_id}/onboardings/{onboarding_id}/continue`\n* **[Create payment](/reference/create-payment)**: **POST**: `https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/payments`\n* **[Capture authorization](/reference/capture-authorization)**: **POST**: `https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/payments/{id}/transactions/{transaction_id}/capture`\n* **[Refund payment](/reference/refund-payment)**: **POST**: `https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/payments/{id}/transactions/{transaction_id}/refund`\n* **[Cancel or refund a payment](/reference/cancel-or-refund-a-payment)**: **POST**: `https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/payments/{id}/cancel-or-refund`\n* **[Cancel or refund a payment with transaction](/reference/cancel-or-refund-payment-with-transaction)**: **POST**: `https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/payments/{id}/transactions/{transaction_id}/cancel-or-refund`\n* **[Transfer onboarding](/reference/transfer-onboarding)**: **POST**: `https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/recipients/{recipient_id}/onboardings/{onboarding_id}/transfer`\n* **[Reverse onboarding transfer](/reference/reverse-onboarding)**: **POST**: `https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/recipients/{recipient_id}/onboardings/{onboarding_id}/reverse-transfer`\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Transaction Retries](/docs/transaction-retries)[Account Funding Transactions (AFTs)](/docs/account-funding-transactions-afts)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Key features](#key-features)\n  + [1.

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/transaction-retries", "title": "Transaction Retries", "content_markdown": "# Transaction Retries\n\nYuno provides merchants with the ability to retry capture and refund transactions that have encountered errors or been declined by the provider. This feature aims to enhance transaction success rates and improve the user experience. By setting the `simplified_mode` field to `true` in [capture](/reference/capture-authorization) and [refund](/reference/refund-payment) requests, Yuno will automatically retry failed transactions up to seven times within a 96-hour period. The system handles the following scenarios during the retry process:\n\n#### Capture transactions\n\nCapture transactions can encounter various statuses during and after the retry process. The table below details these statuses:\n\n| Payment while retry is ongoing | Payment after successful retries | Payment after failed retries |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| SUCCEEDED / CAPTURE\\_RETRY\\_IN\\_PROCESS | SUCCEEDED / CAPTURED or PARTIALLY\\_CAPTURED depending on the amount. | SUCCEEDED / CAPTURE\\_RETRY\\_PROCESS\\_FAILED |\n\n#### Refund transactions\n\nRefund transactions also have specific statuses during and after the retry process. The table below outlines these statuses:\n\n| Payment while retry is ongoing | Payment after successful retries | Payment after failed retries |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| SUCCEEDED / REFUND\\_RETRY\\_IN\\_PROCESS | REFUNDED / REFUNDED or SUCCEEDED / PARTIALLY\\_REFUNDED depending on the amount. | SUCCEEDED / APPROVED |\n\n## Benefits\n\nThis feature provides several advantages:\n\n* **Improved transaction success rates**: Automatic retries enhance the likelihood of successful transaction completions, leading to higher approval rates and increased revenue.\n* **Enhanced user experience**: By automatically retrying failed transactions, user friction is reduced, improving overall customer satisfaction and retention.\n* **Operational efficiency**: Automating retry attempts optimizes time and resources by minimizing manual intervention for failed transactions, allowing teams to focus on strategic tasks.\n\n## Retry scheme\n\nThe retry scheme is crafted to maximize transaction success by scheduling retries at strategic intervals.\n\nThe table below describes the intervals between each retry. Note that each retry is scheduled based on the timing of the last attempt, meaning the time between retries is cumulative:\n\n| Event | Deadline after the first try |\n| --- | --- |\n| First try | - |\n| Second try | 5 minutes |\n| Third try | 50 minutes |\n| Fourth try | 6 hours |\n| Fifth try | 24 hours |\n| Sixth try | 48 hours |\n| Seventh try | 96 hours |\n\nThis table illustrates that each retry is performed based on the time elapsed since the previous attempt, not the initial attempt. For example, the fourth retry occurs 6 hours after the third retry rather than 6 hours after the first attempt. The entire schedule spans 7 days and 7 hours in total.\n\n## Examples\n\nBelow are examples of capture authorization and refund requests using the simplified mode.\n\nCaptureRefund\n\n```\ncurl --request POST \\\n     --url https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/payments/id/transactions/transaction_id/capture \\\n     --header 'X-Idempotency-Key: <Your X-Idempotency-Key>' \\\n     --header 'accept: application/json' \\\n     --header 'charset: utf-8' \\\n     --header 'content-type: application/json' \\\n     --header 'private-secret-key: <Your private-secret-key>' \\\n     --header 'public-api-key: <Your public-api-key>' \\\n     --data '\n{\n  \"amount\": {\n    \"currency\": \"JPY\",\n    \"value\": 300\n  },\n  \"simplified_mode\": true,\n  \"description\": \"Confirmed\",\n  \"reason\": \"PRODUCT_CONFIRMED\",\n  \"merchant_reference\": \"AAB01-432245\"\n}\n'\n```\n\n```\ncurl --request POST \\\n     --url https://api-sandbox.y.uno/v1/payments/id/transactions/transaction_id/refund \\\n     --header 'X-Idempotency-Key: <Your X-Idempotency-Key>' \\\n     --header 'accept: application/json' \\\n     --header 'charset: utf-8' \\\n     --header 'content-type: application/json' \\\n     --header 'private-secret-key: <Your private-secret-key>' \\\n     --header 'public-api-key: <Your public-api-key>' \\\n     --data '\n{\n  \"simplified_mode\": true,\n  \"description\": \"Refund\",\n  \"reason\": \"REQUESTED_BY_CUSTOMER\",\n  \"merchant_reference\": \"AAB01-432245\"\n}\n'\n```\n\nUpdated 5 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Stored Credentials](/docs/stored-credentials)[Split Payments Marketplace](/docs/split-payments-marketplace)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Benefits](#benefits)\n  + [Retry scheme](#retry-scheme)\n  + [Examples](#examples)", "images": [], "source": "Yuno Docs"}
{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/build-reports", "title": "Build Reports", "content_markdown": "# Build Reports\n\nYuno reports provides a practical way to acquire information regarding different stages of payments. You can effortlessly request and download various reports associated with your Yuno operations. Yuno provides four types of reports:\n\n* Payment\n* Transaction\n* Transaction Reconciliation\n* Settlement\n\nYou can check the detailed description for each one by accessing the [Reports Fields](/reference/reports-fields) documentation. The Transaction Reconciliation and Settlement reports provide information related to reconciliation. To examine all fields available on each report and their description, access the [Reports Fields page](/reference/reports-fields).\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo request a report, you will need to:\n\n* Access your [API credentials](/docs/developers-credentials) on the Yuno Dashboard, which consist of:\n  + `public-api-key`\n  + `private-secrete-key`\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Explore Yuno Postman Collections\n>\n> Yuno provides [Postman Collections](/reference/postman-collections) that you can use to replicate the use cases locally.\n\n## Steps summary\n\nThe process to receive a report when using Yuno is composed of two steps:\n\n1. [Create a Report](/reference/create-a-report)\n2. [Download a Report](/reference/download-a-report)\n\n## Access a report\n\nAs shown in the summary of the steps, you need to complete two steps before accessing your report.\n\n### Step 1: Create a report\n\nTo initiate the report generation process, request Yuno to create the report using the [Create a Report endpoint](/reference/create-a-report). First, select the desired report type (`type`), which will determine the content of the generated report. Secondly, define the date range you wish to incorporate data into the report by setting the parameters `start_date` and `end_date`.\n\nWhen creating the report, you can filter the added data by specifying the values for some fields. For example, you may want to receive data only related to transactions performed in Argentina and Brazil. In this case, you would provide the `AR,BR` content for the parameter `country`.\n\nYou have the option to filter the following fields when creating the report:\n\n* `payment_status`\n* `payment_sub_status`\n* `payment_method`\n* `currency`\n* `country`\n* `transaction_type`\n* `transaction_status`\n* `updated_at_start`\n* `updated_at_end`\n\n> 📘\n>\n> ### Filter values format\n>\n> When defining the filter values, provide them in a string value list, such as in the example below:\n> `\"payment_status\": \"CREATED,READY_TO_PAY,DECLINED\"`\n\nFor Payment or Transaction reports, you also have the option to select the fields included in the final report using the parameter `columns`.\n\nWhen you use the [Create a Report endpoint](/reference/create-a-report) to request a report creation, on the response, you will receive the report `id` and `status`. You will use the `id` when requesting the report download on [Step 3](/docs/build-reports#3-download-your-report). The `status` informs if it is ready to download.\n\n### Step 2: Check if the report is ready\n\nAfter requesting the report creation, you can use endpoints [Retrieve a Report](/reference/retrieve-a-report) or [List All Reports](/reference/list-all-reports) to check if it is ready for download. When using the [Retrieve a Report endpoint](/reference/retrieve-a-report), you need to provide the report `id`. On the other hand, with the [List All Reports endpoint](/reference/list-all-reports), you need to inform your `account_id` to receive a list of all existing reports and their status.\n\nWhen the report has the status `SUCCEEDED`, you can request its download. Access the [Report status page](/reference/report-status) to check all possible report status.\n\n### Step 3: Download your report\n\nUse the [Download a Report](/reference/download-a-report) to receive your report providing its `id`. You will receive the report in a .zip file. However, for Settlement reports, the API will return a .csv file.\n\nUpdated about 2 months ago\n\n---\n\n[Capture Payments](/docs/capture-payments)[3DS Configuration and Testing](/docs/3ds-configuration-and-testing)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Requirements](#requirements)\n  + [Steps summary](#steps-summary)\n  + [Access a report](#access-a-report)\n  + - [Step 1: Create a report](#step-1-create-a-report)\n    - [Step 2: Check if the report is ready](#step-2-check-if-the-report-is-ready)\n    - [Step 3: Download your report](#step-3-download-your-report)", "images": [], "source": "Yuno Docs"}

{"url": "https://docs.y.uno/docs/configure-webhooks", "title": "Configure Webhooks", "content_markdown": "# Configure Webhooks\n\n## Setup\n\nYou can configure webhooks using the [Yuno dashboard](https://dashboard.y.uno/):\n\n1. Navigate to the **Developers** tab\n2. Click **Webhooks**\n3. Click **Add webhook**\n\nA sidebar will open where you'll configure:\n\n* **Name**: Identify your webhook\n* **Endpoint URL**: Your server URL to receive notifications\n* **x-api-key**: Your API key (sent in notification headers)\n* **x-secret**: Your secret (sent in notification headers)\n* **Use OAuth2 Authentication**: Optional checkbox for OAuth2\n* **Use HMAC Authentication**: Optional checkbox for HMAC signature verification\n\n**Trigger on**: Select which events will trigger this webhook (enrollment, payment, subscription, etc.)\n\nOnce configured, the webhook will send notifications whenever the selected events occur. The image below shows the side panel to add a webhook.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/d6c9cb749a295424c3ebbb241f29f8480d7df5f0df38e88c6c0c41688900f664-Screenshot_2025-11-04_at_8.25.21PM.png)\n\nIn the [Yuno dashboard](https://dashboard.y.uno/) Developers tab, you can activate and deactivate webhooks using the **Status** toggle button.\n\nAccess the [Webhooks Examples](/docs/examples) page to check examples for payment, enrollment, and many other notification events.\n\n### HMAC authentication\n\nWhen you enable **Use HMAC Authentication** in the dashboard, you'll provide a client secret key. Yuno will use this key to generate an HMAC signature and send it in the `x-hmac-signature` HTTP header with each webhook request, allowing you to verify that webhooks genuinely come from Yuno and haven't been tampered with.\n\nSee the [Verify Webhook Signatures (HMAC)](/docs/verify-webhook-signatures-hmac) guide for implementation details.\n\n### oAuth2\n\nWhen you enable **Use OAuth2 Authentication** in the dashboard, you can configure the following parameters so Yuno can obtain the authorization token that will be sent in the webhook headers:\n\n* `Authentication_url`: url to use for authentication\n* `Credentials`: Necessary credentials to communicate with the authentication\\_url.\n  + Client Secret\\_key\n  + Cliente Client\\_ID\n* `Grant type`: Type of grant for the authentication.\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/3075c93d6bfd9bc1a786206a165768229231928441c12c919717ab38d89df995-Screenshot_2025-02-07_at_10.49.53_AM.png)\n\n## Receipt confirmation process\n\nYuno webhooks expect to receive an HTTP 200 OK status as a response to indicate that the webhook was received. The merchant system response does not need to provide any information on the body request, only the HTTP 200 status. In case of not receiving a response at the specified time, Yuno webhooks will send the event notification up to seven times to avoid information loss. The table below presents the webhooks notification schedule and the confirmation waiting time.\n\n| Event | Deadline after the first try |\n| --- | --- |\n| First try |  |\n| Second try | 5 minutes |\n| Third try | 50 minutes |\n| Fourth try | 6 hours |\n| Fifth try | 24 hours |\n| Sixth try | 48 hours |\n| Seventh try | 96 hours |\n\n## Webhooks event types\n\nDepending on the type of event, you will receive a different type of webhook and event. The next table presents the possible event types for enrollments and payments currently available.\n\n| type | type\\_event |\n| --- | --- |\n| enrollment | enroll |\n| enrollment | unenroll |\n| enrollment | expiration |\n| payment | purchase |\n| payment | authorize |\n| payment | capture |\n| payment | refund |\n| payment | cancel |\n| payment | verify |\n| payment | chargeback |\n| payment | fraud\\_screening |\n| payout | payout |\n| subscription | create |\n| subscription | pause |\n| subscription | resume |\n| subscription | cancel |\n| subscription | complete |\n| onboarding | create |\n| onboarding | pending |\n| onboarding | succeeded |\n| onboarding | canceled |\n| onboarding | declined |\n| onboarding | blocked |\n| onboarding | unblocked |\n\n### Fraud Screening Webhook Behavior\n\nWhen a transaction is declined by the fraud screening and doesn't move forward to processing with any provider, no transactions are created — the `transactions` array comes back empty. In this case, the only elements that get created are within the `fraud_screening` object, and the webhook that's triggered is `payment.fraud_screening`.\n\nIf due to the routing configuration the fraud screening declines but the transaction still proceeds to processing, the event sent to the client is `payment.purchase`.\n\nUpdated 11 days ago\n\n---\n\n[Webhooks Overview](/docs/webhooks)[Object and Examples](/docs/examples)\n\nAsk AI\n\n* [Table of Contents](#)\n* + [Setup](#setup)\n  + - [HMAC authentication](#hmac-authentication)\n    - [oAuth2](#oauth2)\n  + [Receipt confirmation process](#receipt-confirmation-process)\n  + [Webhooks event types](#webhooks-event-types)\n  + - [Fraud Screening Webhook Behavior](#fraud-screening-webhook-behavior)", "images": [{"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/d6c9cb749a295424c3ebbb241f29f8480d7df5f0df38e88c6c0c41688900f664-Screenshot_2025-11-04_at_8.25.21PM.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/d6c9cb749a295424c3ebbb241f29f8480d7df5f0df38e88c6c0c41688900f664-Screenshot_2025-11-04_at_8.25.21PM.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the settings menu in the new facebook app"}, {"original_url": "https://files.readme.io/3075c93d6bfd9bc1a786206a165768229231928441c12c919717ab38d89df995-Screenshot_2025-02-07_at_10.49.53_AM.png", "local_path": "yuno_data/images/3075c93d6bfd9bc1a786206a165768229231928441c12c919717ab38d89df995-Screenshot_2025-02-07_at_10.49.53_AM.png", "alt_text": "", "caption_blip": "the settings in the settings page of the new app"}], "source": "Yuno Docs"}
